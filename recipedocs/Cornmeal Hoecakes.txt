Cornmeal Hoecakes recipe.  Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, kosher salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl. Whisk egg, egg white, and milk in another medium bowl to combine. Mix egg mixture into cornmeal mixture just to incorporate, then stir in melted butter. Heat 1 tsp. butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium, swirling pan to coat bottom. Spoon in half of batter and cook until bubbles appear on top, about 3 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until hoecake is set, about 3 minutes. Return skillet to stovetop, turn cake over with a spatula, and cook over medium heat until cake feels firm when pressed, about 2 minutes. Turn out onto a plate and repeat process with remaining batter and 1 tsp. butter to make a second cake. Serve hoecakes topped with sour cream and scallions and sprinkled with sea salt.
