My Kids' Favorite Banana Pancakes recipe.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. Stir in the melted butter. In a small bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined — don't worry if there are a few lumps. Stir in the bananas and pecans. Lightly grease a large sauté pan or griddle with the nonstick spray or butter. Heat the pan until hot and then spoon out 3 tablespoons of batter per pancake. Cook the pancakes until the tops look dull and a few of the bubbles pop, about 3 minutes. Turn the pancakes over and cook for another minute. Transfer the cooked pancakes to an ovenproof dish and place in a warm oven until the entire batch is ready to be served. My Kids' Favorite Banana Pancakes has 141.0 calories.
