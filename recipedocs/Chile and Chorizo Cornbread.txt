Chile and Chorizo Cornbread recipe. Preheat the oven to 350°. Crumble and fry the Chorizo in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes to render some of the fat.

Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the cornbread turns golden and smells wonderful. Serve hot. Chile and Chorizo Cornbread has 547.0 calories. Chile and Chorizo Cornbread has 24.0 grams of protein.
