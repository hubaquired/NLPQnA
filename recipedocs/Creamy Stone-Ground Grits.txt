Creamy Stone-Ground Grits recipe.  Bring water, salt, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan, then add grits gradually, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat and cook at a bare simmer, covered, stirring frequently, until water is absorbed and grits are thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally to keep grits from sticking to bottom of pan, 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and grits are thick and tender, about 35 minutes more. Grits will have a soft, mashed-potato-like consistency.) Stir in pepper and remaining tablespoon butter. *Available from John Martin Taylor 800-828-4412; www.hoppinjohns.com).

The ingredients of Creamy Stone-Ground Grits are 4 cups water, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 cup coarse stone-ground white grits*, 1 cup whole milk, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.We are always wowed by how complex in both flavor and texture hand-milled grits are compared to their supermarket counterpart, which we don't recommend for this particular recipe. Grits are best when freshly cooked, but if you're making an entire menu, you'll probably want to prepare them the day before (see cooks' note, below). We suggest storing raw grits in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook them.
