Currant Tart recipe. Combine currants and Port in small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Preheat oven to 400°F. Press out crust on lightly floured work surface to remove creases. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Line crust with aluminum foil. Fill foil-lined crust with dried beans or pie weights and bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and beans from crusts. Bake crust until pale golden, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to rack. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in medium bowl until combined. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Stir in currant mixture. Spoon filling into crust. Bake until filling is golden brown, covering edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool 15 minutes. Remove tart from pan. Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pass whipped cream if desired. Currant Tart has 346.0 calories. Currant Tart has 4.0 grams of protein. Currant Tart has 12.0 grams of fat.
