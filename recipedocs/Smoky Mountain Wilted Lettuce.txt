Smoky Mountain Wilted Lettuce recipe. Put lettuce, scallions, and eggs in a salad bowl. Cook bacon in a heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 5 minutes.

Whisk in cream, salt, and pepper, then boil until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Pour hot dressing over salad and toss well. Season salad with salt and pepper, if necessary, and crumble bacon over top. Smoky Mountain Wilted Lettuce has 218.0 calories. Smoky Mountain Wilted Lettuce has 9.0 grams of protein.
