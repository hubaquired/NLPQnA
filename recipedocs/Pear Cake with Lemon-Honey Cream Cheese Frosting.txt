Pear Cake with Lemon-Honey Cream Cheese Frosting recipe.  Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and spices in large bowl. Make well in center of flour mixture. Add oil, eggs, milk and vanilla; whisk just until evenly moistened. Fold in pears and nuts; divide between pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks.
