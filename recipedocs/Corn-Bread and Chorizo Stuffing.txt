Corn-Bread and Chorizo Stuffing recipe.  Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Butter a 3-quart shallow baking dish. Crumble corn bread into 1/2-inch pieces, spreading out in 1 layer in 2 large 4-sided sheet pans. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dry, about 20 minutes. Cool completely and transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, cook chorizo in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onions, celery, garlic, oregano, and 1 1/4 teaspoon salt and sauté until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Add to corn bread. Whisk together broth and egg, then pour over stuffing and toss well. Transfer to baking dish and cover tightly with buttered foil. Bake in upper third of oven 1 hour. Remove foil and bake until top is golden, about 15 minutes more. The ingredients of Corn-Bread and Chorizo Stuffing are Skillet corn bread, 1/4 pound Spanish chorizo (cured spiced pork sausage), casing removed and sausage chopped, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 medium onions, coarsely chopped (3 cups), 4 celery ribs, coarsely chopped (3 cups), 2 tablespoons chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth, 1 large egg.What started as an arepa recipe evolved into a play on traditional American corn-bread stuffing. Chorizo takes the place of fresh sausage, and garlic adds punch to a buttery base. Imagine all of the classic textures with Latino flavorsits that good.
