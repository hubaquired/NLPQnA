Cuban Grilled Pork (Lechon Asado) recipe.  Mix all marinade ingredients in a bowl and let sit for 10 minutes. If using a flavor injector see cooking notes), strain half the marinade into a bowl, adding the strained-out garlic to the other half of the marinade.

If you are not using a flavor injector, use a long, thin knife to create deep gashes all over the flesh and pour the marinade over the pork. Place the marinated pork in a deep bowl or container. Generously season the outside of the pork with salt and pour the remaining marinade all over it, spreading the onion rings all over the top. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. Remove the pork from the marinade and place it on a platter. Transfer the marinade to a saucepan, add the onions, and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
