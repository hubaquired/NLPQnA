Place the salmon on the grill, flesh side down, and grill 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the salmon, and place the squash slices on the grill. Brush the pesto over the salmon and the squash. Grill the squash, turning it occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes until cooked through. Grill the salmon 4 to 5 minutes until the skin crisps but the center is still medium.

Garlic scapes are the young, soft stems and unopened flower buds of hardneck garlic. This variety of
garlic tends to be prevalent at farmer's markets. The season for scapes is short, so if you can't find them you can substitute scallions or baby leeks.
