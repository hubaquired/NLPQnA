Grits Aligot recipe. Bring 1 tsp. salt and 5 cups water to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in grits. Cook, whisking often to prevent clumps, until mixture is thick but grits are still very al dente, 15–20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit until a skin forms on surface, 5–10 minutes. Set grits over medium-low heat and whisk vigorously until smooth. Cook, whisking often, until grits are tender but still have some bite, 15–20 minutes. Whisk in butter, then cream; reduce heat to low. Whisking constantly, add each cheese a little at a time. Whisk after each addition until melted and smooth before adding more. If needed, add water until grits are pourable but still very thick. Season with more salt if needed. Grits Aligot has 266.0 calories. Grits Aligot has 12.0 grams of protein.
