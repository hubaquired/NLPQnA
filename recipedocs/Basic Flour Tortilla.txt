Basic Flour Tortilla recipe. In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients and 1/2 of the water. Mix together with your hands and continue adding water into the dough until it forms a solid ball, but is not too sticky. If necessary, add additional flour or water as needed. Knead the dough on a floured board for 5 minutes. Cut the dough in half and then in half again, continuing the process until you have 8 equal portions. Roll each piece into a ball, place them on a lightly floured surface, and cover with a damp towel. Heat a griddle or cast iron pan to medium heat. Roll out the dough, one piece at a time to about 1/4 inch thickness. Place one round of dough on the griddle and cook on each side for about 30 seconds. Take care that the griddle is not too hot or the tortillas will scorch. Continue the process with the remaining 7 portions of dough. The cooked tortillas will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator or up to six months in the freezer. Basic Flour Tortilla has 288.0 calories. Basic Flour Tortilla has 6.0 grams of protein.
