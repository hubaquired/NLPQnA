Dilly Beans recipe. Stir salt and 1 gallon warm water in a large bowl until salt is dissolved. Let brine cool to room temperature. Layer beans with remaining ingredients in a large ceramic, glass, or stainless-steel mixing bowl. Add brine to cover. Pour remaining brine into a resealable plastic bag; seal and place on beans to submerge. Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Let stand at room temperature until bubbles form around edge of bowl, 4-5 days. Spoon off any foam from surface of brine. Continue to let stand at room temperature, discarding foam as necessary, until beans are pickled, about 2 weeks. Using a slotted spoon, divide beans, herbs, and spices among 3 clean 1-quart jars. Set a strainer with 2 layers of cheesecloth over a large pitcher; pour brine through strainer. Pour over beans in jars, leaving 1/2" space on top. Cover; chill up to 2 months. The ingredients of Dilly Beans are 2/3 cup coarse sea salt, 2 pounds small, tender green beans or yellow wax beans, trimmed, 6 fresh dill sprigs, 6 small garlic cloves, smashed, 3 small dried red chiles (such as cayenne or chile de árbol), 1 tablespoon dill seeds, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed.These brined green beans get their snappy flavor from fermentation.
