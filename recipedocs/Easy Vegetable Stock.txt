Easy Vegetable Stock recipe. In a large stockpot, combine the onion, garlic, celery, carrots, parsley, parsnip, peppercorns, bay leaves, and thyme with 4 qt/3.8 L water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Uncover the pot and simmer for another 20 minutes to slightly reduce the stock to intensify the flavor. Remove from the heat and let cool for at least a half hour before straining. The stock can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 1 week and frozen for up to 1 year. The ingredients of Easy Vegetable Stock are 1 large onion (or more), cut into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm chunks (or 3 leeks, thickly sliced), 2 to 4 garlic cloves, cut in half (no peeling necessary), 2 to 6 celery stalks (tops OK), cut into 2- to 4-in/5- to 10-cm pieces, 2 to 4 carrots, cut into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm pieces, 1 bunch parsley, and more stems if available (stems are especially flavorful), 1 parsnip, chopped into 1- to 2-in/2.5- to 5-cm pieces (optional), 1 tsp whole black peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, 4 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried thyme.It was a challenge for me to write a recipe for vegetable stock, because in truth, mine is different every time. I am inspired to make it whenever I am prepping lots of veggies, and I realize that what I have left over—the tops of four leeks, three parsnip stubs, carrot peels and tips, and a pile of parsley stems—is almost everything I need to make a great stock. When faced with the decision to capture these flavors so they can become the foundation for future delicious soups, stews, or beans, versus adding them to my compost pile, I try to choose the former. Once you experience how much better your recipes turn out with homemade stock (not to mention how much money you save and how many cartons you keep out of the trash), youll get more motivated. I usually keep a bag in the fridge where I save my veggie scraps, and when it gets big enough, I set my pot on the stove. The recipe below is simple and easy. You can also add corncobs, potato skins, mushroom bottoms, and even tomatoes. If you have a huge stockpot, as I do, you can easily double or triple this recipe. I keep as much stock in the refrigerator as I plan to use within 5 days and freeze the rest. —Myra.  Soup Stew Onion Celery Carrot Parsnip Vegan Parsley.
