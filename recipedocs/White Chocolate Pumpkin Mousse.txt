White Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse recipe. Heat chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in a microwave on high 30 seconds. Stir, then heat 15 seconds more. Repeat until chocolate is melted and smooth. Mix pumpkin, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in another medium heatproof bowl. Heat in microwave on high until warm to the touch, about 1 minute. Add a large spoonful of pumpkin mixture to chocolate and whisk to combine. Add one-third of remaining pumpkin mixture to chocolate and whisk to combine. Repeat two more times until pumpkin mixture is incorporated and smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl—mixture should be cool to the touch; if it’s still warm, let sit 5 minutes. Using an electric mixer on high speed, whip cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Add one-quarter of cream to pumpkin mixture and stir to combine. Gently fold in remaining cream. Serve immediately or chill until ready to use. White Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse has 247.0 calories. White Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse has 3.0 grams of protein.
