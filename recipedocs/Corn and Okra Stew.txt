Add onions and poblano and pulse until chopped. Cook onion mixture in oil with cayenne and black pepper in cleaned pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 8 minutes. Add sausage and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add broth and bring to a simmer. Add okra, tomatoes, and salt, then simmer, partially covered, until okra is tender but not falling apart, about 30 minutes. Add corn and shrimp and cook, stirring, until shrimp are just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in scallions and season with salt and pepper. Corn and Okra Stew has 349.0 calories.
