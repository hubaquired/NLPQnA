Boneless Chicken Breasts with Red Chili Sauce recipe. Preheat oven to 400°F. In a saucepan simmer chilies, onion, and garlic in water to cover 20 minutes and with a slotted spoon transfer to a blender. Add 1/2 cup cooking liquid, raisins, and salt and blend until smooth. Sauce may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered. While chilies are simmering, in a bowl stir together yogurt, garlic paste, cumin, and salt to taste. Add chicken and coat with marinade. Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, at least 15 minutes and up to 1 day. In a 10-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add chicken with marinade clinging to it, skinned sides down, and sauté 1 minute on each side, or until golden-brown patches appear. Add chili sauce to skillet and bring to a simmer, uncovered, scraping up any brown bits. Transfer chicken mixture to a shallow baking pan just large enough to hold chicken in one layer and bake, covered, 15 minutes. Remove cover and sprinkle Münster over chicken. Remove pan from oven and let stand 1 minute to melt cheese. Boneless Chicken Breasts with Red Chili Sauce has 229.0 calories. Boneless Chicken Breasts with Red Chili Sauce has 34.0 grams of protein.
