Corvina Traditional recipe.  To make the candied sweet potatoes, put the sweet potatoes, syrup, and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving the syrup, and let cool. Once the potatoes are at room temperature, put them back in the cooled syrup to store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Drain the potatoes well before using. You should have about 2 cups. In a nonreactive bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients until well combined. Add the corvina and toss to combine. Add the celery, red onion, and chopped cilantro and mix well. Transfer the ceviche to individual glasses or a large shallow bowl. Place about 1 cup of the candied sweet potatoes on the sides of the glasses or bowl and top with the cilantro leaves. Serve immediately. The ingredients of Corvina Traditional are 1/3 pound peeled sweet potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch dice, 3/4 cup pure maple syrup, 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, 1/4 cup fresh celery juice, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons aji amarillo paste (see Note), 1 pound skinless corvina fillet, blood line removed and cut into 1/2-inch dice, 1/4 cup very finely diced celery, 3 tablespoons finely diced red onion, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, 1/4 cup whole cilantro leaves.This recipe epitomizes what a great ceviche should beâ€”crunchy, sweet, savory, tart, and rich all in one bite. Corvina, a type of sea bass, is the most widely used fish in South America for ceviche, and is very forgiving for the novice. Its firm, lean flesh holds up better to acid and is easy to either thinly slice or dice.
