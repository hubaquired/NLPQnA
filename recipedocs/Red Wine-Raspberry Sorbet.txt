Red Wine-Raspberry Sorbet recipe.  In a medium saucepan, bring the sugar, water, and red wine to a boil and let boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and add the raspberries. Cover and let steep for 1 hour. To purée the berries and remove the seeds, using a rubber spatula, press the mixture through a mesh strainer set over a medium bowl or pass it through a food mill fitted with a fine disk into a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. For a lighter-tasting sorbet, use rosé in place of the red wine.
