The ingredients of Grape and Rosemary Flatbread are 1 (16-ounce) homemade or store-bought pizza dough, 1 tablespoon truffle oil, 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped, 2/3 cup red grapes, halved, 1/2 teaspoon finishing salt, 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese.Roasting grapes is fun and unexpected, although very popular in the wine regions of Italy. I remember being surprised to find juicy grapes cooked into a dense olive oil cake in Tuscany years ago. Here the sweetness of the grapes balances the earthy truffle oil and rosemary, and the feta adds a salty kick. The flavors are just perfect, and this flatbread takes me right back to Tuscany every time.  HarperCollins Flat Bread Rosemary Grape Bake Appetizer Feta.
