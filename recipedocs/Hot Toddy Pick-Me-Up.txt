The ingredients of Hot Toddy Pick-Me-Up are 6 ounces hot rooibos or strong Black tea (such as Ceylon), 1 ounce bourbon (preferably Wild Turkey; nothing overproof), 1 ounce Cognac (preferably Pierre Ferrand or Hine), 1/2 ounce Bénédictine, 2 dashes Angostura bitters, 1 whole nutmeg, 1 lemon wheel studded with a few cloves, 1 cinnamon stick.The hot toddy is not simply a mixture of hot water and booze. It's a miracle worker, a doctor, and a life coach in a cup. And although it does seem to do the trick for everything from a sore throat to a cough, it's just as good when you're healthy. This version—from Damon Boelte, bar manager at Prime Meats restaurant in Brooklyn—omits the usual honey or sugar and plays up the herbal and spicy notes instead.
