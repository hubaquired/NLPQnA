Zucchini Tagliatelle with Mint, Cucumber, and Lemon recipe. Using mandoline or V-slicer and working with 1 zucchini at a time, thinly slice lengthwise, discarding first strip. Slice up to seeded core; turn zucchini and continue to slice until only rectangle of seeded core remains; discard core. Place slices in medium bowl. Add cucumber, onion, 1/2 of chopped mint, and lemon peel. Whisk lemon juice and pistachio oil in small bowl, then pour over zucchini mixture; toss to coat. Season with salt and generously with pepper. Cover zucchini mixture and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Sprinkle remaining chopped mint over salad and toss to coat. The ingredients of Zucchini Tagliatelle with Mint, Cucumber, and Lemon are 6 small to medium zucchini (about 1 1/2 pounds total), trimmed, 1 large cucumber (about 13 ounces), peeled, seeded, diced, 1 cup finely chopped Vidalia or Maui onion, 1 1/2 cups (loosely packed) fresh mint leaves, coarsely chopped, divided, 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon peel, 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 2 tablespoons pistachio oil.This pretty salad gets its name from the long slices of zucchini, which resemble tagliatelle pasta. I like to mix in some fresh mint and lemon for a nice zip, cucumber and sweet onion for crunch, and pistachio oil for fabulous depth of flavor.
