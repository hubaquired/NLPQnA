Saffron Rouille recipe. Sprinkle saffron over hot water in a small cup and let stand 1 minute. Blend saffron mixture with remaining ingredients and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth. The ingredients of Saffron Rouille are 1/8 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads, 1/4 teaspoon hot water, 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup chopped roasted red peppers, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne.Rich, aromatic rouille is a classic lily-gilding for French fish soups; this one has an extra something special: saffron. Even if you love saffron, though, don't be tempted to add any extra threads. This is just the right amount to really flatter, not dominate, the soup.
