The ingredients of Pumpkin Potato Puree are 1 1/2 pound large boiling potatoes, 1/2 stick unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 cup canned pure pumpkin, 3/4 cup whole milk, warmed, 1/4 pound Italian Fontina cheese, diced (about 1 cup), 1 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped sage, 1 tablespoon cider vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg.This side dish of silky mashed potatoes sweetened with pumpkin (left over from Pumpkin Muffins ), seasoned with fresh sage, and laced with melty strands of Fontina cheese is full of favorite autumnal flavors. But, surprisingly, it's the cider vinegar that really makes this dish singâ€”just a tablespoon of this stealth ingredient adds a roundness that ties the whole dish together. We love it with pork chops or turkey cutlets.
