Lefse recipe.  Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Prick potatoes all over with a fork and bake directly on the rack until yielding when pressed, about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, scoop flesh into a large bowl; discard skins or nibble on them with butter and salt— we won't judge). Mash potato with a fork until only a few lumps remain. Let cool. Mix in cream, butter, salt, and 1 1/4 cups flour with a fork until a shaggy ball forms. Turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead, working in more flour a tablespoonful at a time, until dough is smooth, elastic, and soft, about 3 minutes. Cover loosely and let rest 10 minutes. Divide dough into 12 portions. Heat a dry griddle or large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. Working with 1 portion at a time and keeping others covered, roll out dough on a floured surface as thinly as possible to make an irregular 8"-diameter round perfection is overrated). Cook until dough looks dry and is browned in spots, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer lefse to a wire rack; let cool. DO AHEAD: Lefse can be made 2 days ahead.
