Butternut Squash with Pumpkin-Seed Pesto recipe.  Preheat oven to 500Â°F with rack in middle.

Meanwhile, toast pumpkin seeds in 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until seeds are puffed and beginning to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a large plate and cool. Pulse cooled seeds in a food processor with cilantro, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, and remaining tablespoon oil to a coarse paste not finely ground). Toss squash with pesto and salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
