The ingredients of Cool Jade Soup are 3 pounds lima beans in pods, shelled (scant 3 cups beans), or 2 (10-ounces) packages frozen baby lima beans, thawed, 1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces (5 cups), 4 cups water, 2 1/2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth, 2 scallions, chopped, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, 1/4 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves, 1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves, 2 tablespoons dill leaves, 2 tablespoons mint leaves, 1/2 cup olive oil.The inspiration for test kitchen director Ruth Cousineaus velvety chilled bean soup comes from Mediterranean-cooking authority Claudia Roden's recipe for bissara, an Egyptian bean-and-herb purée. The beans here are lima and green, simmered in chicken broth (you can use vegetable broth if you want to go vegetarian) and then puréed until silky. The herbs—parsley, cilantro, dill, and mint—are blended with olive oil so that you can finish the soup with a verdant drizzle, but dont think of the herb oil as merely a garnish: Its bright flavor brings everything together.
