Slow-Cooked Garlicky Greens recipe.  Working in batches, cook greens in a large pot of boiling heavily salted water until just barely wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain; let cool, then squeeze out excess water with your hands. Coarsely chop; set aside. Heat a clean large pot over medium. Cook garlic and 1/2 cup oil, smashing down on garlic with a wooden spoon, until golden and soft, about 4 minutes. Add chiles de árbol and cook 30 seconds to infuse the oil with chile. Reduce heat to medium-low; add reserved greens. Cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until greens are deep green and tender, 20–30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer greens to a platter and drizzle with more oil. The ingredients of Slow-Cooked Garlicky Greens are 4 pounds mixed hardy greens (such as Tuscan kale, curly kale, Swiss chard, and/or collard greens; about 6 bunches), ribs and stems removed, Kosher salt, 4 garlic cloves, lightly crushed, 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling, 2 chiles de árbol or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, Freshly ground black pepper.When working with a large quantity of greens, it’s much easier to sauté them if they’re blanched first. Their time in the olive oil is more for flavoring and reaching the ideal texture.
