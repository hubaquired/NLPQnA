Farmers Market Salad with Aged Gouda and Roasted Portabellas recipe. Preheat oven to 425Â°F with rack in middle. Toss mushrooms with 3 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a bowl. Roast in 1 layer in a 4-sided sheet pan, turning once, until golden-brown and tender, about 15 minutes. Cool mushrooms. Whisk together vinegar, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 5 tablespoons oil in a bowl until combined. Toss mushrooms, greens, and cheese with enough dressing to coat. The ingredients of Farmers Market Salad with Aged Gouda and Roasted Portabellas are 3/4 pounds sliced portabella mushrooms, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided, 3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 10 cups mixed spicy greens such as mustard, arugula, tatsoi, mizuna, and watercress, 1 cup coarsely grated aged Gouda cheese.Lobes of golden mushrooms, shreds of buttery Gouda cheese, and the heartiness of spicy greens come together in this substantial salad. It's a terrific companion to the chive shortcakes, stew, and baked tomatoes, but keep it in mind when all you're after is a soup-and-salad supper.
