Ratatouille Sandwich recipe. Use a 6-quart slow cooker. Put the eggplant, onion, bell peppers, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes into the insert. Add the pasta sauce, oil, salt, and black pepper, and stir well to combine. Cover, and cook on low for 8 hours, or until the vegetables have broken down quite a bit and the onion is translucent. Serve on the buns with a slice of cheese on top, if desired. Ratatouille Sandwich has 89.0 calories. Ratatouille Sandwich has 3.0 grams of protein. Ratatouille Sandwich has 2.0 grams of fat.
