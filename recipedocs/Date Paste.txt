Date Paste recipe. Place the dates in a large bowl. Pour the water over the dates. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let soak—tender Medjool dates only need about 10 to 15 minutes to soak, while drier Deglet Noor dates can use a soak of about 1 hour. Drain the dates, reserving the soaking water. Place the dates in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process until the paste is very smooth, with few discernible bits of date skin in the mix. You're looking for a texture and thickness sort of like an airy peanut butter or apple butter—the paste should be very smooth, move freely in the processor, and not cling to the sides of the bowl. If it appears a little chunky or sticky, add a bit of the soaking water, just a teaspoon at a time to avoid making it too runny. Ultimately, the paste should be a medium caramel color, spoonable, and hold its shape when you scoop some out. Use the paste immediately, or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. Date Paste has 275.0 calories. Date Paste has 2.0 grams of protein.
