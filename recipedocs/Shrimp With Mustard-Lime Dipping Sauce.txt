Shrimp With Mustard-Lime Dipping Sauce recipe. Using kitchen shears and working one at a time, cut along the length of the backs of shrimp, cutting through shells and just deep enough into flesh to expose veins; remove veins. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil and add 1/4 cup Old Bay seasoning. Squeeze lemon juice into water and add lemon halves to saucepan; return water to a boil. Add shrimp, reduce heat, and simmer until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Drain and pat dry. Just before serving, whisk oil and remaining 1 tablespoon Old Bay in a medium bowl. Add shrimp and parsley and toss to coat. Do ahead: Shrimp can be cooked 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Whisk mayonnaise, brown mustard, lime juice, honey, brown sugar, mustard powder, and Worcestershire sauce in a medium bowl; season with hot sauce and salt. Serve shrimp with dipping sauce and lime wedges. Shrimp With Mustard-Lime Dipping Sauce has 344.0 calories. Shrimp With Mustard-Lime Dipping Sauce has 9.0 grams of protein.
