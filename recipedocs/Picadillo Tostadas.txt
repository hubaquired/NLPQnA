Picadillo Tostadas recipe.  In a large heavy skillet cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the pork, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until the pork is no longer pink. Pour off any excess fat, add the raisins, the tomato sauce, the olives, the cinnamon, the cloves, and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is thickened. The picadillo may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated before proceeding. In a skillet heat 1/4 inch of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the tortillas, 1 at a time, for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are crisp and golden, and transfer them with tongs as they are fried to paper towels to drain. Arrange the tostada shells in one layer on platters, divide the picadillo among them, and top it with the lettuce and the onion. Picadillo Tostadas has 624.0 calories.
