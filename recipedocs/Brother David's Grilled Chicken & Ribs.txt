Brother David's Grilled Chicken & Ribs recipe.  Lightly brush your grill with olive oil and preheat it to approximately 350Â°F. In the meantime, rinse the meat, pat it dry, and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Arrange the chicken and ribs on the grill. Resist turning the meat for at least 5 minutes. This will help it sear nicely. After 5 minutes or so, turn the meat over, sear the other side for 5 more minutes. Turn again, and this time, brush the meat with the barbecue sauce. Then turn again every 5 minutes, repeating the process of brushing the meat with sauce until the chicken and ribs are cooked through and the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize and form a crust on the meat 35 to 40 minutes). Serve with more barbecue sauce on the side. Brother David's Grilled Chicken & Ribs has 960.0 calories. Brother David's Grilled Chicken & Ribs has 69.0 grams of protein.
