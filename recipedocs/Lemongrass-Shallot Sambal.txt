Lemongrass-Shallot Sambal recipe. Cut off the hard, brown bottom end and the bristly, greenish top of the lemongrass stalk, which will leave you with a pale, white-and-lilac piece approximately 5 inches long. Discard the tough outer layers. Slice the lemongrass very thinly, then chop the slices as finely as you can â€” using a very sharp knife will help you enormously. Chopping lemongrass this thoroughly may take a few extra minutes, but it should be the consistency of sand by the time you've finished prepping it. Transfer the lemongrass to a bowl. Make sure that the chiles and shallots are chopped just as finely. Add the chiles, shallots, oil, lime juice, and salt to the bowl. Stir well to combine. Taste again, and add a pinch more salt if needed. Transfer to a small serving bowl for guests to spoon from directly and let rest for 10 minutes before eating to allow the flavors to meld.
