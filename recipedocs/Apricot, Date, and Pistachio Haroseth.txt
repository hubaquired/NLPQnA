The ingredients of Apricot, Date, and Pistachio Haroseth are 2/3 cup whole almonds with skin, toasted and cooled, 2/3 cup unsalted shelled pistachios, 1 cup dried apricots (preferably California/Pacific), coarsely chopped (5 ounces), 2/3 cup pitted dried dates, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup cream Sherry, 1 (3- by 1/2-inch) strip orange zest, finely chopped (1 teaspoon), 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.Harosetha thick condiment of fruit, nuts, and winesymbolizes the mortar the Israelites used in Egypt. Robertss particular mix of almonds, pistachios, dates, and dried apricots, reflective of the Middle East, is outstanding (note that we prefer the sweet-tart complexity of California/Pacific apricots to the bland sweetness of Turkish ones). Enjoy leftover haroseth slathered on matzos or crackers; we discovered its great with Manchego cheese as well.
