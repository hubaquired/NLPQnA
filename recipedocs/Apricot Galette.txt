Apricot Galette recipe.  Preheat oven to 425Â°F. In a food processor pulse almonds with confectioners' sugar until finely ground. Pit apricots and cut into 1/8-inch-thick wedges. On a lightly floured surface unfold pastry sheet and cut out a 9-inch round. Transfer round to a buttered large shallow baking pan and prick pastry all over with a fork. Spoon almond mixture evenly over pastry, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Decoratively arrange apricot wedges, overlapping them, on top of almond mixture and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake galette in middle of oven until edges are golden brown, about 30 minutes. With a metal spatula transfer galette to a rack to cool. Apricot Galette has 515.0 calories.
