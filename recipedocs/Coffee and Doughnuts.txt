Coffee and Doughnuts recipe. Make the doughnuts: The day before you want to serve the doughnuts mix 1 1/2 tablespoons yeast with warm water. When mixture foams, put 4 cups flour and the yeast mixture into the bowl of a large mixer. Using a dough hook, mix and knead until thoroughly incorporated. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, mix remaining yeast with warm milk. Place remaining 4 cups flour, salt and sugar in large mixing bowl. When yeast foams, add yeast mixture, yolks and melted butter to dry ingredients, mixing until incorporated. Let mixture rest for 1 hour. Combine the two doughs in a mixer, using a dough hook, until completely incorporated. This may take 5-10 minutes on a low speed. Roll dough to desired thickness and cut into desired shape for doughnuts. Cover dough pieces with a damp towel and let rest at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Uncover and let rise in a warm place. Fry in 325Â°F oil until golden. Drain on paper towels and roll in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately. Makes about 3 dozen 2-inch doughnuts.
