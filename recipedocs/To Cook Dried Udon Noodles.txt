This condition is what the Japanese refer to as koshi, or "substance," just as the Italians enjoy their pasta al dente.) If necessary, cook for another minute and check again. If you will be serving noodles hot, scoop them up into a strainer and lift from pot to drain. Do not pour off cooking liquid; boiling water in pot can be used both to re-heat noodles, and to warm bowls in which they will be served.) If you will be serving noodles cold, drain them. Whether serving noodles hot or cold, rinse them well under cold running water to remove surface starch that would otherwise make them gummy. Then drain. Set noodles aside until ready to eat â€” they can be held for up to several hours refrigerate if holding for more than 20 minutes).
