The ingredients of Spaghetti with Parsley Pesto are 1 pound spaghetti, Kosher salt, 1/2 cup unsalted, roasted almonds, 4 cups (packed) fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, 3/4 cup chopped fresh chives, 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan, Freshly ground black pepper.We love a classic pesto Genovese. But why be limited to basil? Swapping in flat-leaf parsley makes for a balanced sauce that allows you to really taste the nuts, the olive oil, the Parmesan. Sturdy parsley is also easier to find year-round (and more affordable) than basil. Use this sauce as you would any pesto: spooned over grilled vegetables, spread on a sandwich, and, yes, swirled into pasta. Bonus: Parsley pesto holds its vibrant color much longer than the other stuff.
