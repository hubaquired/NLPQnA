The ingredients of Baked Chicken with Barbecue Sauce are 12 chicken thighs with skin and bones (about 3 3/4 pounds), 1 14 1/2- to 16-ounce can crushed tomatoes with added puree, 1/4 cup (packed) golden brown sugar, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/4 cup French's mustard.A century ago, spicy English mustards like Colman's were too pungent for American tastes, even in small quantities: Back then, mustard was used only in salad dressings. George French came along in 1904 with a formula for a milder condiment he called French’s Cream Salad Mustard. Eventually slathered on everything from bologna sandwiches to soft pretzels, French’s mustard is also delicious in this barbecue sauce.  Chicken Mustard Bake Fall Grill Barbecue Bon Appétit.
