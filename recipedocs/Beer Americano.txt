As any serious fashionista knows, nothing helps one pull the trigger when wavering over a new handbag or pair of cufflinks like a little liquid encouragement. At Trussardi Café, bartender Tommaso Cecca has not only transformed the brand’s fragrances into aromatic cocktails, but made his own twists on Italian classics, such as the Americano. Replacing soda water with a beer float makes for a frothy, refreshing cocktail. For a lighter, more floral version of this cocktail, Cecca uses dry white vermouth, Weizen or wheat beer, and a lemon peel as garnish. To achieve Trussardi-worthy froth at home, try using an Aerolatte, a mini whisk-blender more commonly used to prepare milk foam for a cappuccino.  Cocktail Beer Campari Italy Aperitif.
