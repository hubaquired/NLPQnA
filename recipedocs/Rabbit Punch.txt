Muddle to release the citrus oils, then let stand 1 to 2 hours. Add the lemon and pineapple juices and the bourbon, and stir to combine. Just before serving, stir in 3 to 4 cups of ice, then top with Champagne or sparkling wine and garnish with the orange slices and pineapple chunks. Rabbit Punch has 150.0 calories.

The combination of pineapple, orange, and lemon plus the crisp, dry bubbles from the Champagne really wake up your palate after a long winter, he says. The citrus and sugar base is called oleo-saccharum, and is common in older punch recipes. Wallace says it's an excellent way to add a subtle citrusy perfume to the final drink, and requires time but very little labor.
