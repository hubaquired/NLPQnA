Salmon Confit in Olive Oil with Arugula Salad and Balsamic Vinegar recipe. Combine the olive oil with the Bouquet Garni in a shallow, heavy-bottomed pan large enough to hold the salmon in a single layer over very low heat until the oil reaches 150°F on an instant-read thermometer. Add the salmon and cook, at a constant temperature, for about 5 minutes or just until the salmon has begun to firm up. Using a slotted spatula, lift the salmon from the pan and place on a double layer of paper towels to drain. Place a small mound of micro arugula in the center of each of four plates. Lay a piece of salmon on top of the greens on each plate. Sprinkle sel de Guerande over the salmon. Drizzle a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar over the salad and salmon on each plate and serve.
