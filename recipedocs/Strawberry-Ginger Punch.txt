Strawberry-Ginger Punch recipe.  Combine sugar, 1/2 cup strawberries, half of ginger, and 1/3 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until berries soften, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Strain and set syrup aside. Muddle 2 cups strawberries, 1/4 cup basil, and remaining ginger in a large jar or bowl. Add brandy, lime juice, and reserved syrup and stir to combine. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours to let flavors meld. Strain mixture into a large punch bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible.
