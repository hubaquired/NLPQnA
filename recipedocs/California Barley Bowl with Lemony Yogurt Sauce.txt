California Barley Bowl with Lemony Yogurt Sauce recipe.  In a small bowl, stir the barley, sprouts, cheese, almonds, and kosher salt together. Scoop into 2 individual bowls and top with the avocado and a few generous spoonfuls of yogurt sauce. Sprinkle with flaky salt and pepper and serve. The ingredients of California Barley Bowl with Lemony Yogurt Sauce are 1 1/2 cups / 255 g cooked barley, still warm, 1 cup / 55 g bean sprouts, any variety (I like mung bean sprouts), 1/3 cup / 60 g crumbled Cotija cheese or queso fresco, 1/4 cup / 20 g sliced almonds, toasted, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 small ripe avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced or sliced, Lemony Yogurt Sauce, Flaky salt, Freshly ground black pepper.If you grew up in Northern California in the 1990s, you lived through the trend that was sprouts. From alfalfa sprouts to bean sprouts, they seemed to find their way into every green salad, sandwich, and omelet. This savory whole-grain breakfast bowl is inspired by those California days, with chunks of ripe avocado, crumbled Cotija cheese, toasty almonds, and a citrus-sparked yogurt sauce. While alfalfa sprouts were prevalent when I was growing up, today I try to branch out, using a tangle of colorful bean sprouts or more delicate radish or sunflower sprouts. These morning bowls couldn't be easier to prepare, but the barley does take a while to cook; I put a pot on the stove first thing in the morning so it'll be ready by the time I've had my coffee and prepped the other ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other grains, too. I've tried this with both quinoa and farro, and it's as wonderful with delicate grains as it is with heartier ones.
