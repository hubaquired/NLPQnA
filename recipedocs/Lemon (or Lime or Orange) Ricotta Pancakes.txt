Lemon (or Lime or Orange) Ricotta Pancakes recipe.  Stir the pancake batter and citrus zest together in a bowl. Ever so gently fold in the ricotta cheese, taking care not to destroy its texture.

Turn and very gently tap the pancakes with a metal spatula to make them uniform in thickness. Cook until the second side is golden, about 2 minutes, and serve A-side up. The ingredients of Lemon (or Lime or Orange) Ricotta Pancakes are 3 cups pancake batter (such as Aunt Jemima frozen batter, thawed, or scratch batter), Zest of 2 lemons, 2 limes, or 1 orange, 2/3 cup fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese, Peanut oil for the griddle, Butter for the griddle and for serving, Warm Grade B maple syrup for serving.My editor, Peter Gethers, insisted on only one thing when he asked me to write this book: that I include the recipe for these pancakes. The ricotta causes them to burn more easily than other pancakes, so you need to cook them over medium-low to medium heat. If there are any pancakes that don't need maple syrup, these are them.
