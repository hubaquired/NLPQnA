The ingredients of Mustard Greens with Chipotle and Bacon are 2 3/4 pounds curly mustard greens (2 to 3 bunches), stems and coarse ribs discarded, 4 bacon slices, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon minced canned chipotle chiles in adobo, 1/2 teaspoon salt.Though they're a nod to the classic pairing of cooking greens with a ham hock, these gently bitter greens have several important differences: Because they are blanched rather than braised, they hold their intense color; bacon crumbled over the top, rather than cooked with the greens, retains its crispness; and smoky chipotle gives the dish an alluring heat.
