Hurricane has 6.0 grams of sodium. The ingredients of Hurricane are 1 ounce light rum, 1 ounce dark rum, 1 tablespoon passion fruit syrup, Juice of 1/2 lime, 1 teaspoon superfine sugar, or to taste, Ice cubes.Passion fruit syrup can be difficult to find. We located a bottle by contacting a distributor, Fee Brothers. (Call 800-961-3337 or write to info@feebrothers.com) Because the syrup is hard to come by (and artificially flavored) we devised a substitute for it that was well received: a tablespoon of passion fruit sorbet (HÃ¤agen Dazs makes one) and a teaspoon of grenadine, per serving.
