Curry-Coconut Shrimp recipe. Combine the coconut milk, fish sauce, lemon juice, bell pepper, minced cilantro, sugar, and curry powder in a 10-inch glass pie plate. Add the shrimp, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Bring water to a boil over high heat in a covered steamer or pot large enough to hold the pie plate. Wearing oven mitts, carefully place the pie plate into the steamer. Cover, lower the heat to medium, and steam for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the shrimp are just cooked through. Using oven mitts, carefully lift the lid of the steamer away from you, and remove the pie plate from the steamer. Serve the shrimp over the brown rice. Garnish with the lemon wedges and cilantro sprigs, if using. Curry-Coconut Shrimp has 278.0 calories. Curry-Coconut Shrimp has 27.0 grams of protein. Curry-Coconut Shrimp has 6.0 grams of fat.

The ingredients of Curry-Coconut Shrimp are 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 3 tablespoons seeded and finely chopped red bell pepper, 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro leaves, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon curry powder, 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined, 2 cups cooked brown rice, 4 lemon wedges, for serving, Fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional).Shrimp absorbs the flavors of a marinade rapidly, making this quick entr√©e ideal for a busy weeknight. Steaming gently cooks the shrimp and reduces the likelihood of overcooking. Regular coconut milk offers the best flavor for this dish, as the taste of light coconut milk is too subtle. I often serve it over brown rice or whole wheat noodles.
