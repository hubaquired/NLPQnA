Green Juice recipe.  Trim both ends off the lemon, then stand it on a cut side and use a sharp paring knife to cut off the peel, including the white pith; discard the peel. Cut the segments free from the membranes. Feed the lemon segments, apple, celery, kale, and parsley through a juicer. Stir in the turmeric and serve immediately. Green Juice has 128.0 calories.

His turmeric-infused green juice features apples, celery, kale, and parsley but it's a flexible recipe, so feel free to experiment with different veggie combinations. Bolanos recommends swapping in Japanese cucumber for the celery, and substituting Swiss chard for the kale.
