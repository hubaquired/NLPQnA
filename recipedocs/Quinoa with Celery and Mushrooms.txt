Quinoa with Celery and Mushrooms recipe. In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Add the quinoa and diced celery, return to a boil, reduce the heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 12 to 14 minutes, and stir in the celery leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The ingredients of Quinoa with Celery and Mushrooms are 3 cups chicken stock, 1 1/2 cups quinoa, 3 medium stalks celery, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 cup), leaves reserved, 1 cup wild mushrooms, cut into pieces and sautéed, 1/2 cup lightly packed celery leaves, finely chopped, Kosher salt, Freshly ground black pepper.I can just hear someone shouting "Oh, no, not quinoa again," but this is really good. I made it for friends who cannot eat onions or garlic. Looking around for a solution, I found that the freezer had two plastic containers of Boletus mushrooms that I had picked, cooked, and frozen in the summer. If—as is probable—fresh Boletus are not available, use another good mushroom. Even if you don't forage as I do, you will find an expanding selection of flavorful mushrooms in shops—labeled "wild" only to differentiate them from regular mushrooms. They need not be frozen. In fact, they will need to be defrosted if frozen.
Don't worry if this makes more than you need. My friends took home the remains, and so will yours.  Mushroom Side Quick & Easy Wheat Gluten-Free Lunch Quinoa Celery Healthy Sugar Conscious Dairy Free Peanut Free Tree Nut Free Soy Free No Sugar Added Kosher.
