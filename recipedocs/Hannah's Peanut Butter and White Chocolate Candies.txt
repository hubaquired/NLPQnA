It's an interest I share with my daughter, Hannah. We do a phenomenal amount of cooking together. In fact, I think she learned how to count using chocolate chips, standing on a stool next to me at the kitchen counter while I baked chocolate croissants. Now Hannah's early training is paying off: She creates new recipes often, including the peanut butter and white chocolate candies here.".
