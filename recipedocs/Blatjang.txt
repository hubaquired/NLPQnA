Blatjang recipe.  Combine the apricots, raisins and vinegar in a 5-litre 5-quart) saucepan. Soak overnight to plump the fruit. Alternatively, if time is tight, simply cover, bring to the boil and set aside for about 2 hours. Add the remaining ingredients, and cook uncovered over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first, then constantly towards the end of the cooking time, until the chutney has reduced to about one-third, and is beautifully thick. It should take 1 1/2-2 hours. To know when it is ready for bottling, test the consistency by putting a little in the freezer to cool. Pour into hot, sterilized jars, seal and store in a cool, dark cupboard. Blatjang has 342.0 calories. Blatjang has 5.0 grams of protein. Blatjang has 6.0 grams of fat.
