Pappadams (Lentil Wafers) recipe. Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a wok or 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until a tiny piece of pappadam dropped in oil quickly bobs to surface and expands about 350Â°F). Reduce heat to medium-high. Slip 1 pappadam into oil and let it expand to its full size and turn light brown, 10 to 30 seconds. Using tongs, flip it over quickly and fry other side until light brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining pappadams. If pappadams don't expand immediately, oil is too cool; if they brown too quickly, oil is too hot.) The ingredients of Pappadams (Lentil Wafers) are About 5 cups vegetable oil, 12 plain pappadams (about 4 inches in diameter).In North India these legume wafers are called papad and are dry-roasted over a flame, but in the South they are deep-fried until they form lots of air bubbles and become light and puffy. They are sold in many flavors, but plain is preferred in Kerala. Pappadams are always part of a Sadhya: You crush one up and mix it together with rice, dhal, and ghee. The pappadam helps to bind all the ingredients together so you can form balls when eating with your hand. Store-bought wafers are used almost exclusively by Indian cooks because the traditional recipes are labor-intensive and require days of drying in the hot sun.
