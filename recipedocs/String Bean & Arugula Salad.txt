String Bean & Arugula Salad recipe. Heat the grill to medium-high. In a large bowl, toss the string beans with the olive oil and garlic. Let the beans rest for 10 minutes or so, then place the beans on a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Fold the foil over the beans and fold down the ends of the foil twice. Place the foil packet on the grill, seam side up, and grill for 25 to 30 minutes. Let the beans cool for a few minutes, then combine them in a roomy bowl with the arugula, lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing until the arugula is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.

The ingredients of String Bean & Arugula Salad are 3/4 pound green and/or yellow string beans, trimmed, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed, 2 cups baby or regular arugula, trimmed and chopped, 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, Salt and freshly ground black pepper.In this unusual pairing, the string beans and baby arugula work wonders for each other. Wilting the arugula with the hot, garlicky grilled beans is a nice trick for bringing the two together. While you can use regular arugula if you must, baby arugula is far milder in flavor, so try to find it if you can.
