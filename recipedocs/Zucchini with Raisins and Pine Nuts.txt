The ingredients of Zucchini with Raisins and Pine Nuts are 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 large cloves garlic, very thinly sliced, 4 small-to-medium zucchini, trimmed and cut into slices about 3/8 inch thick, 2 medium tomatoes, coarsely chopped, 1 teaspoon anchovy paste, 2 tablespoons golden raisins, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, several good grinds black pepper, 1 tablespoon pine nuts, lightly toasted.The use of raisins and pine nuts in lightly sweet-and-sour sauces probably came to Sicily from Turkey; these ingredients also turn up in the cooking of Venice, long a commercial gateway to Turkey and the East, but less commonly in the anchovy-and-tomato sauces that are so fundamental to the Sicilian kitchen. Note that the zucchini in this dish is cooked rather soft, in the traditional Italian manner; if you want a more contemporary crisp product, add the zucchini toward the end for a quick cooking in the thickened sauce.
