Medianoche (Midnight Sandwich) recipe. Spread both sides of each roll with mustard. Layer the bottom half with ham, pork, and
cheese to cover the bread from end to end. Top with sliced pickles to taste. Brush the outside
of the bread, both top and bottom, with butter. Heat a sandwich press over medium heat. Lightly brush the inside of the press with
additional butter. Press the sandwich until the cheese is melted and the meats are warm,
3 to 5 minutes. Alternately, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Create a press by
wrapping a brick, heavy skillet, or can of soup in aluminum foil. Place the sandwich in
the skillet and press down on the sandwich, turning once, until it is warmed through and
the outside crust is golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.

The ingredients of Medianoche (Midnight Sandwich) are 4 large rolls Pan de Media Noche or sweet roll-like brioche or challah, sliced lengthwise, 4 tablespoons yellow mustard, 12 ounces sweet-cured ham, thickly sliced, 8 ounces Lechón Asado, sliced, trimmed of any excess fat, and at room temperature, 4 ounces Swiss cheese (Emmentaler or Jarlsberg), thinly sliced, 2 large dill pickles, thinly sliced crosswise, 4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled to room temperature, plus more for greasing.The Cubano’s cuter cousin, the Media Noche was sold as a late-night snack in Havana’s cafés. Calling for the same blend of sweet-cured ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles, it works best with juicier cuts of pork—though what really sets it apart is the egg-rich Pan de Media Noche.
