Lentil and Rice Salad recipe.  Bring water, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, then stir in rice. Return to a boil and cover pan. Reduce heat to low and simmer rice until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. While rice is simmering, cook lentils in a saucepan of boiling water until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a sieve. Spread rice and lentils in a shallow baking pan and cool 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss gently with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining ingredients, and salt and pepper to taste. Lentil and Rice Salad has 314.0 calories.

Served chilled or at room temperature, the salad is terrific with any meat, poultry, or fish. You could add chickpeas, corn, or more lentils for a vegetarian main course.
