Za'atar recipe. Put the sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat. Toast the seeds, tossing the pan occasionally, until they become fragrant and start to lightly brown. Immediately transfer them to a bowl to cool; if you leave them to cool in the pan, they could burn. Stir in the sumac, thyme, cumin, and salt. Transfer to a small jar with a lid and store in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. Za'atar has 90.0 calories. Za'atar has 3.0 grams of protein. Za'atar has 5.0 grams of fat.

My father was Assyrian, so I've always enjoyed the flavors of the region (though the closest I've yet traveled is Turkey). This is my interpretation, and it reflects my priorities: my favorite part of za'atar is the tart sumac, so it's particularly heavy in my version. And while some cooks grind their spices together, I like to leave the sesame seeds whole. You can find sumac in Middle Eastern groceries and from online sources such as Penzeys and Kalustyan's. For a perfect, quick snack, combine with olive oil and brush on pita.  Spice Thyme Cumin.
