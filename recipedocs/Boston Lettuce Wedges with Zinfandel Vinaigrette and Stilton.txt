Boston Lettuce Wedges with Zinfandel Vinaigrette and Stilton recipe. Quarter lettuce heads lengthwise, keeping stem ends attached. Carefully wash in cold water, then dry in a salad spinner. Whisk together vinegar, shallot, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, then add oils in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Spoon vinaigrette over lettuce wedges, then scatter with nuts and cheese. The ingredients of Boston Lettuce Wedges with Zinfandel Vinaigrette and Stilton are 2 large heads Boston lettuce, 3 tablespoons Zinfandel vinegar or other good-quality red-wine vinegar (preferably "O" brand), 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup walnut oil, 1 cup walnut pieces, toasted, 1/4 pound Stilton, crumbled or shaved (with a cheese plane).We'll admit itâ€”we all love a wedge of iceberg with blue-cheese dressing. So there's no need to apologize for serving this beautiful plate of sweet lettuce, slices of good Stilton, and toasted walnuts, along with an excellent vinaigrette that brings out the best in all of them.
