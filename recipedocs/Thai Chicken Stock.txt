Thai Chicken Stock recipe. Crack chicken wing bones in several places with back of a cleaver or large knife on a cutting board. Bring all ingredients to a boil in an 8- to 10-quart pot, skimming froth as necessary, then reduce heat and gently simmer, partially covered, 2 1/2 hours. Remove pot from heat and cool stock to room temperature, about 1 hour. Pour stock through a large fine-mesh sieve lined with a triple thickness of cheesecloth into a large bowl and discard solids. Measure stock: If there is more than 10 cups, boil in cleaned pot until reduced; if there is less, add water. If using stock right away, skim off and discard fat. If not, cool stock completely, uncovered, before skimming fat it will be easier to remove when cool), then chill, covered. Thai Chicken Stock has 52.0 calories.
