Strozzapreti Carbonara With Radishes recipe.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook pancetta, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Mix in egg yolks, egg, cheese, and pepper. Wipe out and reserve skillet. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add pasta, 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid, and radishes to sauce; toss to combine. Transfer to reserved skillet and cook over low heat, moving skillet on and off heat, to keep sauce from curdling, and stirring constantly, until sauce is smooth and coats a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes. Divide pasta among bowls and top with chervil, if desired. Strozzapreti Carbonara With Radishes has 666.0 calories. Strozzapreti Carbonara With Radishes has 25.0 grams of protein.
