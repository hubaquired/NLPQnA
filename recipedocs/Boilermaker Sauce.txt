The ingredients of Boilermaker Sauce are 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 2 large garlic cloves, minced, 1 12-ounce bottle chili sauce, 3/4 cup beer, 1/4 cup unsulfured (light) molasses, 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, 3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco).A boilermaker is a classic one-two drink consisting of a shot of whiskey followed by a beer chaser. Those ingredients also come together in this all-American barbecue sauce. Use it on ribs, pork chops, chicken, even burgers (brush it on during the last ten minutes of grilling). If making ribs, brush them often during the first part of cooking with a mixture of one part cider vinegar to ten parts water and a pinch of dried crushed red pepper; that will keep them moist. This recipe makes enough for three pounds of meat or poultry and can be doubled easily.  Sauce Summer Molasses Bon Appétit.
