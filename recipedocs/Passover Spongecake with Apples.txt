Beat together yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until pale and very thick. Stir in zest and juice. Beat whites with salt in another bowl with cleaned beaters on high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and beat until whites just hold stiff, glossy peaks. Fold cake-meal mixture into yolk mixture, then fold in whites in 3 batches. Stir together remaining tablespoon sugar and cinnamon. Spoon one third of batter into an ungreased 9-inch springform pan.
