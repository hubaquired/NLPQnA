Turkey Bone Broth recipe.  Preheat the oven to 375°F. Remove the breasts, thighs, and wings from the turkey carcass. Spread the turkey parts out in an even layer on a large baking sheet, along with the neck and any innards that came with the turkey. Dust everything  with sea salt and place in the preheated oven. Roast until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Transfer everything from the baking sheet to a large stockpot or slow cooker. Cover with the water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Skim off the fat and scum that rises to the top and discard; this process takes about 1 hour. Add vinegar, peppercorns, thyme, and rosemary. Continue to simmer for 8 hours, adding water as necessary just to keep the bones covered. Add vegetables in the last 5 hours of cooking. Gently strain or ladle the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a container. Fill your sink with ice water. Place the container of broth in the ice bath to cool for 1 hour. Use the broth right away, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 1 year. Turkey Bone Broth has 50.0 calories. Turkey Bone Broth has 7.0 grams of protein.
