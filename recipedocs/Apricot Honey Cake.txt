"Was the food better growing up in Czechoslovakia or were the people hungrier there? My mother made a honey cake for the holiday, and it was so delicious. Honey was too expensive for us, so my mother burned the sugar to make it brown. Here I use pure honey, but I still think my mother's cake was better and I know I am wrong. The taste of hers is still in my mouth.".  Cake Rum Fruit Dessert Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur Apricot Almond Fall Kosher Honey Vegetarian Pescatarian Dairy Free Peanut Free Soy Free.
