Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks recipe.  Combine the Guinness, salt, sugar, water and 2 tablespoons spice rub in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Drop in the lamb steaks, press out the air, and seal. Refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours. Light a grill for direct medium-high heat, about 425°F. Remove the lamb from the brine and pat dry. Discard the brine. Coat the lamb with the oil and season with the rub. Set aside for 10 minutes. Brush the grill grate and rub with oil. Grill the steaks for about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare 135°F on an instant-read thermometer). Baste with a thin layer of the sauce during the last minute of grilling. Rest the meat for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the steaks with the remaining sauce on the side. The ingredients of Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks are 2 cups Guinness ale, 1 tablespoon coarse salt, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 3 tablespoons Smokin' Rub, 3 pounds bone-in lamb leg steaks (see Know-How), 1 tablespoon canola oil, 1 1/2 cups Guinness BBQ Sauce.Guinness, the Irish stout, gives the brine for these simple barbecued lamb steaks much of its punch. Like most dark beers, Guinness has a bittersweet molasses flavor, which is great with lamb. But the hidden power of a Guinness brine is its alcohol content (about 4 percent). Alcohol accelerates the absorption of flavorful components directly into the protein structure of meat, yielding a steak that not only retains about 10 percent more moisture, but also is able to deliver a hit of seasoning with every bite. The flavors of chipotle chiles and cumin in the brine are reinforced with a smoky rub and a dark, pungent Guinness BBQ sauce. A word of warning: the sauce burns easily, so only brush it on the meat at the very end of grilling. In fact it is more flavorful served as a table sauce, although the steaks do look nice varnished with glaze.
