Star Anise Ice Cream recipe.  In a heavy saucepan combine the milk, the cream, the sugar, and the star anise, bring the mixture just to a boil, and remove the pan from the heat. In a bowl whisk together the egg yolks, add the cream mixture in a stream, whisking, and pour the mixture back into the pan. Cook the custard over moderately low heat, stirring, until it registers 170Â°F. on a candy thermometer, strain it through a fine sieve set over another bowl, and let it cool completely. Stir in the Pernod and freeze the custard in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Star Anise Ice Cream has 215.0 calories. Star Anise Ice Cream has 5.0 grams of protein.
