Confit Cherry Tomatoes recipe. Preheat the oven to 200Â°F. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Using a paring knife, mark a shallow X on the bottom of each tomato. Add to the boiling water for 3 to 4 seconds. Immediately transfer to an ice bath and, once cool, remove the skins with a paring knife, being careful not to cut into the flesh. Toss the peeled tomatoes in the olive oil, salt, and sugar. Place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 1 1/2 hours, until the tomatoes are slightly shriveled and about one-quarter of their original size. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Confit Cherry Tomatoes has 13.0 calories. Confit Cherry Tomatoes has 1.0 grams of fat.
