Cook until tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the pan from the grill. Using a spoon, scoop the fuzzy choke from each of the halves. Transfer the cleaned halves to a new sheet pan. Using your hands or a brush, evenly, but lightly, coat both sides of the artichokes with canola oil.
