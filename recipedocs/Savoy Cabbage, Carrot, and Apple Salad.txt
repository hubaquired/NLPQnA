Savoy Cabbage, Carrot, and Apple Salad recipe.  Whisk together juices, oil, and caraway seeds. Season with salt and pepper and toss with cabbage, carrots, and apple. Let stand at room temperature, tossing occasionally, 40 minutes to allow flavors to blend and cabbage to wilt. The ingredients of Savoy Cabbage, Carrot, and Apple Salad are 3 tablespoons apple juice, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds, lightly crushed, 1/2 head Savoy cabbage, cored and very thinly sliced (4 cups), 2 large carrots, very thinly julienned (2 cups), 1 Granny Smith apple, quartered, cored, and sliced crosswise 1/8 inch thick, fresh parsley leaves (preferably flat-leaf).The homey and hearty dishes of Louis Szathmáry—a splendidly mustached man who was the chef-owner of Chicago's well-known Hungarian restaurant The Bakery—are the inspiration for this dinner. Of course, chef Louis cooked using lots of butter and cream, but with just a touch of fat we've retained many of the same earthy flavors that he loved.
