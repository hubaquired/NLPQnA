Mom's Deviled Ham Spread recipe.  In a bowl stir together ham, chili, Worcestershire sauce, just enough mayonnaise to bind ingredients, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill ham spread, covered, overnight. Serve spread with accompaniments. The ingredients of Mom's Deviled Ham Spread are 1 1/2 cups minced cooked ham (about 6 ounces), 1/4 small habanero chili, or to taste, seeded and minced (wear rubber gloves), Worcestershire sauce to taste, 2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, Accompaniment: celery boats and/or toast points.My mother is a member of a club that meets during the months of July and August on Martha's Vineyard, where we have summered for more than thirty-five years. One season the members compiled a souvenir cookbook, and my mother contributed her recipe for a deviled ham spread that she makes from leftover ham. Like deviled eggs, it's devilishly simple and satanically good. It can be spread on pieces of celery or toast points. Those who do not want to use ham can substitute smoked chicken or smoked turkey.
