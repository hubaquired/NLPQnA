Marblehead Soft Scrambled Egg, Corn, and Cheddar Cheese recipe.  Heat the butter in a nonstick egg pan over medium heat. Whisk the eggs, cheese, and cream together in a bowl. Pour into the pan and cook the eggs as for Scrambled Eggs. When the eggs are almost done, add the corn and continue to cook until the eggs are done and the corn is warmed through. The ingredients of Marblehead Soft Scrambled Egg, Corn, and Cheddar Cheese are 1 teaspoon clarified butter, regular butter, or ghee, 6 extra-large eggs, 1/3 cup feather-shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 teaspoon heavy cream, A big handful of frozen corn kernels (about 1 cup).I named this for Lloyd Kramer, a regular customer and a onetime pretty famous reporter, now director, who's from a suburb outside Boston called Marblehead. Lloyd is on a healthy diet now, but before that, when he ordered what he wanted, this is what he ate. It has a ton of cheese in it. The frozen corn cools down the eggs, allowing me to cook them over a higher fire than I normally cook scrambled eggs and still have really creamy eggs.
