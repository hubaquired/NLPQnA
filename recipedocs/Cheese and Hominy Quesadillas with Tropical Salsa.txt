Place 2 quesadillas in each skillet. Cook until bottoms are crisp and brown, pressing occasionally with spatula, about 2 minutes. Turn quesadillas over. Cook until bottoms are brown and cheeses melt, adding more oil as needed, about 2 minutes longer. Cut quesadillas into quarters. Arrange 4 quarters on each of 4 plates. Serve with salsa.
