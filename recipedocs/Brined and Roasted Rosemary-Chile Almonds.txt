Brined and Roasted Rosemary-Chile Almonds recipe. Bring kosher salt, 2 rosemary sprigs, 4 chiles, and 4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring to dissolve salt. Add almonds and remove from heat; cover and let sit 24 hours. Preheat oven to 375°F. Drain almonds; discard rosemary and chiles. Spread out almonds on a rimmed baking sheet; add remaining 4 chiles and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Toss to coat. Roast almonds, tossing occasionally, until dried out and completely toasted through and fragrant, 45-55 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, pick leaves from remaining 6 rosemary sprigs. Heat remaining 1/2 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium. Working in batches, fry rosemary leaves until bright green and crisp, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Add fried rosemary to almonds, season with sea salt, and toss to combine. Do ahead: Almonds can be roasted 3 days ahead.
