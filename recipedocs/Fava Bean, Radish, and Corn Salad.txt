Fava Bean, Radish, and Corn Salad recipe.  Cook the fava beans in a pot of simmering salted water for 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked al dente. Drain in a colander and shock immediately in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and place in a medium mixing bowl. Place 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a preheated sauté pan. Add the shallots and cook over medium heat for 1 minute or until the shallots are translucent. Add the corn to the pan and cook for 3 minutes or until the corn is just cooked. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Add the corn, radishes, chives, basil, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil to the bowl with the fava beans. Mix until thoroughly combined, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Equally divide the salad between four bowls and enjoy. The salad can be served at room temperature or chilled. The ingredients of Fava Bean, Radish, and Corn Salad are 1 1/2 cups shucked fava beans, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 shallot, minced, 1 1/2 cups corn kernels, 8 breakfast radishes, sliced on the bias, 2 tablespoons chopped chives, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, Salt and freshly ground black pepper.Any side dish or salad that includes corn is pretty, but fava beans and striking-looking breakfast radishes—with their elongated shape, rosy red color, and creamy-looking root ends—make this dish more appealing and appetizing than most. Like most chefs, I love favas, but if you can’t find them or think they are too much trouble, replace them with lima beans.  HarperCollins Salad Side Bean Lima Bean Corn Radish Spring Summer.
