Vin D'orange (Orange Wine) recipe.  Place the orange skins, wine, vodka, coffee beans and the vanilla beans in a non-reactive bowl. Add half the sugar and stir. Place the remaining half of the sugar in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and let it caramelize to a deep golden, rotating the pan from time to time to make sure all of the sugar caramelizes evenly. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the caramel into the bowl holding the oranges and the liquid, being careful to pour slowly so that the caramel doesn't get on your skin. The caramelized sugar will immediately turn hard, but don't be concerned. It will eventually melt into the liquid. Cover the bowl and let sit for six days, stirring several times a day. Strain the wine through three thicknesses of cheesecloth and decant into bottles. Cork the bottles and let them sit for at least 1 month and up to 1 year before opening.
