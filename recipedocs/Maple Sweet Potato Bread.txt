Maple Sweet Potato Bread recipe.  Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Lightly grease two 7 1/2×3 1/2–inch loaf pans and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg replacer and water together. Add the sweet potato puree, maple syrup, and Earth Balance, whisking to combine. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, oats, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and allspice and stir. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the sweet potato mixture. Stir to combine. Stir in the currants and almonds. Divide the mixture into the prepared loaf pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack.
