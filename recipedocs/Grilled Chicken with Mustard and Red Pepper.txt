Grilled Chicken with Mustard and Red Pepper recipe.  Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small bowl, combine the mustards and red pepper; stir to blend. Place the eggs in a shallow platter, and whisk lightly with a fork to blend. Using a pastry brush, brush the mustard mixture all over the chicken legs and thighs. Dip them in the eggs, coating evenly on all sides. Sprinkle with the breadcrumbs, coating as evenly as possible. Place the chicken pieces side by side in a roasting pan. Dot with the butter. Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, basting frequently. The chicken is done when the juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer the pieces to a wire rack to help firm up the coating, about 5 minutes. Serve hot or cold. This simple dish suggests a simple red, either a Saumur-Champigny or a young Côtes-du-Rhône. I love Michel Richaud's rich reds from the village of Cairanne.
