The ingredients of Vanilla Sugar (Vanillezucker) are 2 cups/400g granulated sugar, 1 vanilla bean.While you can make a very nice vanilla sugar by simply plunging a vanilla bean into a jar of sugar and leaving it there (for a really, really long time), I actually like to make a slightly fancier version by processing vanilla and sugar together until the bean is all broken down and the sugar is speckled with countless tiny beans and specks of pod. The sugar is more intensely flavored than regular vanilla sugar. Packaged in a pretty glass jar, it also makes for a great gift.  Dessert Edible Gift Vanilla Christmas.
