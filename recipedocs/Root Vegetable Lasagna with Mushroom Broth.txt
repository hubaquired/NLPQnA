Root Vegetable Lasagna with Mushroom Broth recipe. Lasagna: Preheat oven to 325°F. Place a double layer of butternut squash in the bottom of a 12" baking pan that's been greased with butter and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Season squash with salt and pepper to taste and top with 2 tbsp shallots, garlic, and thyme. Layer remaining vegetables individually, seasoning each layer with shallots, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Dot top with butter, sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.
