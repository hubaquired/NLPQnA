Clementines in Ginger Syrup recipe.  Bring water, sugar, ginger, cardamom, and star anise to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 15 minutes. Strain syrup through a sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Chill, covered, until cold, at least 2 hours. Cut peel from clementines, including all white pith, with a sharp knife, then cut fruit into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and put in a serving bowl. Add syrup and chill, covered, at least 1 hour. Just before serving, sprinkle with pomegranate seeds if using). The ingredients of Clementines in Ginger Syrup are 1 1/2 cups water, 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup thinly sliced peeled ginger, 4 green cardamom pods, 3 whole star anise, 6 clementines or mandarin oranges, 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds (optional).Like cinnamon in this country, cardamom plays a starring role in Algerian sweets. Paired with star anise in a gingery syrup, it gives clementine slices an irresistible aroma, but the syrup would be just as wonderful over any kind of sliced fruit.
