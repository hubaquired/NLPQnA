Blueberry and Cinnamon Breakfast Oaty Muffins recipe. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a muffin tin with 12 paper muffin cases. Put 1 1/4 cups of the oats into a food processor and
blitz them until they form a fine powder. Then add
the almond milk, dates, egg, baking powder, and
cinnamon and blitz together to give a fairly smooth
and sloppy mixture. Tip the mixture into a large bowl and gently stir in
the blueberries until well mixed through. Divide the
mixture evenly among the 12 muffin cases. I like to
use a mechanical ice cream scoop to do this. Sprinkle over the remaining oats and bake in the
oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until the muffins are
cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to cool a little
before tucking in. Blueberry and Cinnamon Breakfast Oaty Muffins has 111.0 calories. Blueberry and Cinnamon Breakfast Oaty Muffins has 4.0 grams of protein.

The ingredients of Blueberry and Cinnamon Breakfast Oaty Muffins are 1 1/3 cup gluten-free oats, divided, 1 2/3 cup unsweetened almond milk, 1/2 cup Medjool dates, pitted, 1 free-range egg, 2 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 2/3 cup fresh blueberries.I have lots of people asking me to create gluten-free recipes that do not just rely on the gluten-free flour that can be found in the shops. I have experimented with almond flour (ground almonds), but find that the resulting bakes can be quite heavy, which does not suit all baked goods, and also highly calorific. So while I use ground almonds in some things, I do like to use oats in others. The cinnamon in this recipe adds a lovely taste to the blueberries,
as well as helping regulate blood sugar levels.  HarperCollins Muffin Breakfast Wheat Gluten-Free Oat Date Cinnamon Blueberry Quick and Healthy Kidney Friendly Vegetarian Pescatarian Peanut Free Soy Free No Sugar Added Kosher.
