Strawberry Shortcakes recipe. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease a baking sheet. Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl. Add the butter. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, rub it into the dry ingredients until mixture resembles a coarse meal. Stir in the milk until a very soft dough is formed. Do not overwork. Drop the dough in 6 equal portions onto the prepared baking sheet. Lightly pat the dough into rounds—3 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter—and lightly brush the tops with the cream. Bake the shortcakes in the center of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Place strawberries in a bowl. Sprinkle with lemon juice and sugar, then gently toss with a rubber spatula. Let rest for 1 1/2 to 2 hours for juices to develop. Just before serving, whip cream with 1 Tbsp sugar until it holds soft peaks. To serve, slice off the top third of each shortcake. Place the bottoms on 6 dessert plates and top with 1/3 cup of the prepared berries and juice, plus a spoonful of whipped cream. Cover with the top. Spoon over more berries and juice, then dollop with whipped cream. Garnish each with a whole berry and drizzle with any remaining juice. Strawberry Shortcakes has 278.0 calories.
