Currant Mustard-Glazed Ham recipe. If the ham comes with the skin still attached, remove most of it with a sharp knife, leaving a collar of skin around the shank bone and a layer of fat. Trim the fat, leaving a layer about 1/3 inch thick, score the layer remaining into diamonds, and stud the center of each diamond with a clove. Bake the ham on a rack in a roasting pan in a preheated 350Â°F. oven for 55 minutes. In a small saucepan heat the jelly over moderate heat, stirring, until it is melted and smooth, remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the mustard. Spoon the glaze over the ham, spreading it evenly, and bake the ham for 30 to 35 minutes more, or until the glaze is brown and bubbly. Transfer the ham to a platter and let it stand for 15 minutes before carving. If planning to make the ham, spinach, and pasta gratin page 117), reserve 1 pound of the carved ham, covered and chilled.
