Coconut Pound Cake recipe.  Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Butter a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan and dust with flour, knocking out excess flour. Whisk together flour 2 cups), baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes with a stand mixer or 8 to 10 minutes with a handheld. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in extracts. Reduce speed to low, then mix in flour mixture until just combined. Fold in coconut gently but thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Spoon batter evenly into loaf pan, smoothing top. Bake until golden and a wooden pick or skewer inserted into center comes out clean, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Cool cake in pan on a rack 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of cake, then invert onto rack and cool completely. Coconut Pound Cake has 299.0 calories. Coconut Pound Cake has 4.0 grams of protein.
