Mojito Marinade recipe.  Mix together the garlic, onions, orange juice, and lime juice in a bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan til just smoking. Now cover up your arms and put some potholder mitts on your hands because you're about to do something that is contrary to good cooking practice but produces great flavor release. Slide the contents of the bowl into the hot oil — be very careful because the liquid will splatter. Simmer for 5 minutes to soften the onions and garlic. Season the marinade with the rest of the ingredients. Pour everything into a blender or food processor and pulse 3 times to combine. Pour into a plastic container and cool to room temperature; then cover and refrigerate. Mojito Marinade keeps for up to 2 weeks. Mojito Marinade has 220.0 calories.

The real thing is all tarted up with the juice of bitter oranges — nearly impossible to find. So we add a touch of lime juice to freshly squeezed orange juice to give it the right kick. It's one of the most versatile pantry ingredients you can make. Use it as a marinade for pork and chicken, pour it over cooked veggies or potatoes, or toss it with salad greens.
