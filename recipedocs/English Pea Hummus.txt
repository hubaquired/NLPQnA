English Pea Hummus recipe. In a large saucepan over high heat, bring 3 quarts water and 1/2 cup kosher salt to a boil. Prepare an ice bath of 3 quarts water and ice with 1/2 cup kosher salt stirred in until dissolved. Add the shelled English peas to the boiling water and cook until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. When sweet and tender, immediately remove the peas from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Let sit until the peas are fully cooled, 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Combine blanched peas, green garlic, mint, chervil, lemon, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper in a food processor and puree until smooth. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed.

The ingredients of English Pea Hummus are Kosher salt: 1 cup, plus 1/2 teaspoon or more to taste, 2 cups fresh shelled English peas (about 2 pounds unshelled), 1 stalk green garlic, chopped (or 1 small garlic clove, chopped), 2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, 1 tablespoon fresh chervil leaves, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste.Though the healthful and now mainstream Middle Eastern dip we know as hummus typically includes chickpeas and sesame tahini, this adaptation contains neither. Rather, its similarly smooth texture comes from the natural starch and protein of the English pea. In the summer, I make a variation of this using blanched field peas of any variety, and I substitute thyme for the spring herbs and fresh garlic in place of the early green garlic of spring.
