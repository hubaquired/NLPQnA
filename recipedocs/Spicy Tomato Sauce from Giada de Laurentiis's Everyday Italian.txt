Spicy Tomato Sauce from Giada de Laurentiis's Everyday Italian recipe. In a large skillet, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. When almost smoking, add the onion and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the olives, capers, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and red pepper flakes, and sauté for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and simmer until reduced slightly, about 20 minutes. Season the sauce with more salt to taste. The sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before using.) The ingredients of Spicy Tomato Sauce from Giada de Laurentiis's Everyday Italian are 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 small onion, minced, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1/2 cup pitted black olives, coarsely chopped, 2 tablespoons drained capers, rinsed, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste, Generous pinch of dried crushed red pepper flakes, 1 28-ounce can crushed Italian tomatoes.The sauce known as all'arrabbiata—or "in the angry style"—is made with hot red pepper flakes (and sometimes fresh chilies for an extra kick). I like to use the briny elements of olives and capers and skip the fresh chilies, adding depth to the spiciness rather than just more heat. Perfect with penne or rigatoni.
