To prepare the salad: Remove the green, feathery stalks from the fennel bulb, thinly slice the white part of the fennel bulb on a Japanese mandolin or with a knife.

Let sit for 30 minutes this will soften the fennel slices a bit). Add the orange segments to the bowl and toss gently. Place the arugula in a medium mixing bowl and toss with remaining dressing. Divide the arugula among 4 plates and top with some of the fennel mixture. Season with a twist of freshly ground black pepper. The ingredients of Fresh Fennel and Arugula With Meyer Lemon Dressing are 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 tablespoons Meyer lemon juice, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 medium fennel bulbs, 2 oranges, peeled and separated into segments, 4 cups baby arugula leaves.I love crunchy fennel and peppery arugula dressed with a slightly sweet dressing made from Meyer lemons—a fresh-tasting pick-me-up. Meyer lemons are only available in the wintertime, so if you can’t find them, use regular lemon juice and replace a third of it with fresh orange juice.
