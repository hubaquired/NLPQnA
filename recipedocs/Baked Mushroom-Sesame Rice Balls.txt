Baked Mushroom-Sesame Rice Balls recipe.  Put the rice in a large pot along with a big pinch of salt. Add enough water to cover by about 1 1/2 inches. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles gently. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding more boiling water if the rice begins to stick to the bottom, until the grains are very tender and burst, about an hour. Meanwhile, put the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it's hot, add the mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until dry, lightly browned, and almost crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. When the rice is starchy and very thick, stir in the mushrooms, transfer to a bowl, and let cool in the fridge, at least 45 minutes and up to 24 hours. When you are ready to bake the rice balls, heat the oven to 375Â°F and grease two large baking sheets. Pour the sesame seeds into a shallow bowl. Roll the rice mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls, dip each ball into the sesame seeds to coat it completely, and put the balls 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake the rice balls, turning them as needed, until crisp and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately, passing soy sauce at the table. Baked Mushroom-Sesame Rice Balls has 364.0 calories.
