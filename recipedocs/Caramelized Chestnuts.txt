Remove from heat, then prop skillet up against a ramekin or metal cookie cutter, tilting it just enough for caramel to pool. Add 1 chestnut to caramel and evenly coat by turning with 2 forks, then transfer with forks to a sheet of foil to cool. Coat remaining chestnuts in same manner. If caramel starts to harden, melt over moderately low heat, stirring.) Once completely cooled, peel chestnuts from foil. Caramelized Chestnuts has 98.0 calories.
