Grilled Beef, Jícama, and Apple Salad recipe. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Season the steak with the salt and pepper and grill until medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Let the meat rest for 5 minutes, then cut across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, vinegar, and sugar and whisk until the sugar is partially dissolved. Using the shredder attachment of a food processor, shred the jícama and apples; transfer to a bowl. Add the cilantro, lime zest, jalapeño, and dressing, and toss to combine. To serve, mound 1 1/2 cups of the salad into each serving bowl and top with about 7 slices of beef. Garnish each bowl with additional cilantro leaves and about 2 teaspoons of toasted peanuts. Serve immediately.
