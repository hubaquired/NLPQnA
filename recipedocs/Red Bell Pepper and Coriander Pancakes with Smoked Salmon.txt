Red Bell Pepper and Coriander Pancakes with Smoked Salmon recipe. In a bowl stir together all pancake ingredients except egg whites and season batter with salt and pepper.

Working in batches, drop tablespoonfuls of batter into skillet to form pancakes 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden, about 1 minute. Turn pancakes and cook until undersides are golden. Transfer pancakes to a rack and cool. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon sour cream onto center of each pancake and top with a twisted smoked salmon strip and a coriander leaf.
