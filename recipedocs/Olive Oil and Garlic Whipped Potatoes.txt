Olive Oil and Garlic Whipped Potatoes recipe. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Separate garlic head into cloves, discarding loose papery outer skin but keeping skin intact on cloves, and wrap tightly in foil. Roast garlic in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until soft. Unwrap garlic and cool slightly. Peel skins from each clove and on a plate with a fork mash garlic pulp until smooth. While garlic is roasting, peel potatoes and cut into 2-inch pieces. In a 4-quart kettle cover potatoes with cold salted water by 2 inches and simmer until potatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. With a potato masher mash potatoes. Add garlic pulp, 3/4 cup oil, milk, salt, nutmeg, and pepper and with an electric mixer beat until smooth. Serve potatoes drizzled with remaining 1/4 cup oil.
