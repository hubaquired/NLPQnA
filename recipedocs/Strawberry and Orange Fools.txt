The ingredients of Strawberry and Orange Fools are 1 12-ounce basket fresh strawberries, hulled, coarsely chopped, 3/4 cup chilled whipping cream, 1/3 cup plain yogurt (do not use low-fat or nonfat), 5 tablespoons sugar, 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice, 1 teaspoons grated orange peel, 2 teaspoons Cointreau or other orange liqueur (optional), Additional strawberries halved.Fools are traditionally prepared with pureed fruit mixed with whipped cream, or egg custard, or a combination of the two. (The term fool probably comes from the French fouler, meaning "to crush.") They seem to be especially successful when made with sharply flavored garden produce like rhubarb, gooseberries, and black currants, which still have enough bite to be interesting when blended with cream. But strawberries, which are much easier to find, also work quite nicely. Strawberry fool is best when the fruit is mashed rather than pureed, resulting in a more appealing texture. Serve it with cookies.
