Working with end pieces only, score flesh in a cross-hatch pattern, being careful not to cut through skin, and grill, cut side down, on a well-oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, mango may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat in same manner.) Transfer mango as grilled to a platter. When end pieces of mango are cool enough to handle, push from skin side to turn inside out. Grill remaining mango slices about 2 minutes on each side. Grilled Mango has 102.0 calories.
