Sparkling Tarragon-Gin Lemonade recipe. Muddle tarragon sprigs, lemon slices, and sugar in a large pitcher. Add gin, St-Germain, lemon juice, and club soda. Add ice and stir to combine. Serve over ice. The ingredients of Sparkling Tarragon-Gin Lemonade are 10 large sprigs tarragon, 2 lemons, thinly sliced, 2 tablespoons sugar, 3/4 cup gin, 3/4 cup St-Germain (elderflower liqueur), 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 12-ounce can club soda.For a zippier, more refreshing cocktail (that's what summer drinks are about, right?), it's all in the wrist. Muddling extracts essential oils to deliver maximum herb impact. Tarragon flavors the boozy lemonade here, but basil makes an excellent sub. And while muddled mint is essential to a Mojito, you won't believe what it can add to a Margarita. Shake up a few and see.
