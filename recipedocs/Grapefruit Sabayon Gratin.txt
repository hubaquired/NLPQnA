Grapefruit Sabayon Gratin recipe. Preheat broiler. Cut peel, including all white pith, from grapefruit with a sharp knife. Cut segments from membranes and divide segments among gratin dishes. Combine yolks, sugar, and wine in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and beat with a handheld mixer at medium-high speed until mixture registers 140Â°F on thermometer, about 4 minutes. Continue beating over heat until mixture has tripled in volume and forms a thick ribbon when mixer is lifted, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat. Spoon sabayon over grapefruit segments and broil 4 to 6 inches from heat just until sabayon is browned, about 30 seconds. Serve immediately. Grapefruit Sabayon Gratin has 133.0 calories.
