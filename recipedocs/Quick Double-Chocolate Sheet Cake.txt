Quick Double-Chocolate Sheet Cake recipe. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and line a 11 x 7 x 2-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, place the softened butter, sugar, eggs, and dissolved cocoa. Sift over the flour and baking powder. Using a hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Using a metal spoon, fold in the chocolate chips. Turn the mixture into the greased pan and spread it out evenly. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until risen and springy to the touch. Cool slightly before turning out onto a wire rack. Once the cake is cool, in a bowl, place all the frosting ingredients and, using the hand mixer, beat together well. Spread over the cake. Run a fork across the surface of the frosting to create a wavy pattern of lines. Quick Double-Chocolate Sheet Cake has 426.0 calories. Quick Double-Chocolate Sheet Cake has 5.0 grams of protein.
