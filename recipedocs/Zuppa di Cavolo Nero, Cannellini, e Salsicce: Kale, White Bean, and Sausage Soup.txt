Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup recipe. Sauté the crumbled sausage in the oil until browned, and reserve. Sauté the onions and garlic until translucent. Add to the chicken stock in a big pot. Add the wine and cook until the alcohol has evaporated, then add the thyme and kale. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the cooked sausage and the beans and simmer another 15 minutes. The ingredients of Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup are 2 Italian sausages, skins removed and meat crumbled, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 2 onions, chopped, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 2 quarts chicken stock, 1 cup white wine, 6 thyme sprigs, 1 bunch of kale, washed and chopped, 4 cups cooked cannellini beans.Kale goes by another name, one much more dashing, especially in Italian. Cavolo Nero, black cabbage, may not evoke superhero status, but it's close. Kale does seem invincible and it's known to make the eater more so, too. It's also called dinosaur kale (also called lacinato), maybe because its leaves look like the back of a lizard. Those thin knobby leaves squeak. Do not confuse cavolo, accent on the first syllable, with cavallo, accent on the second, or you'll be ordering black horse, and in certain parts of the world will find it. Hearty and good for the spirit. I like soaked and cooked cannellini better than canned ones.
