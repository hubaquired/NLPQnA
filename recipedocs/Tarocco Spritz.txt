Tarocco Spritz recipe. Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Split open the vanilla bean with a small knife and scrape the contents into the pan; add the bean pod. Turn the heat on low and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Strain, bottle, and store in the refrigerator for up to one month. Add the gin, Cappelletti, orange juice, lemon juice, and vanilla syrup to a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake until chilled. Strain over fresh ice, top with the Prosecco, and add the garnish. The ingredients of Tarocco Spritz are 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 1 vanilla bean, 1 ounce gin, 1/2 ounce Cappelletti, 3/4 ounce fresh blood orange juice, 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice, 1/2  ounce vanilla syrup, 2 ounces Prosecco, 1 blood orange wheel, for garnish.Inspired by a cocktail from New York City bartender Natasha David, the crimson-colored Tarocco Spritz is a nod to the flavor and color of the Sicilian Tarocco orange, often referred to as the “half-blood orange.” A mixed-heritage cocktail, this drink has a bumped-up base of gin to match the vibrant bitter aperitivo liqueur Cappelletti. The drink’s acidity comes courtesy of blood orange, lemon juice, and prosecco, bound together by the unlikely addition of vanilla, which complements Cappelletti’s notes of spice and oxidation.
