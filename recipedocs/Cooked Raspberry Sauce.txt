Cooked Raspberry Sauce recipe.  Combine the berries and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook the berries and sugar for about 5 minutes, allowing them to boil very gently, or until they are slightly thickened. Cool the mixture and puree it in a blender. Strain the sauce into a bowl to remove the seeds. Stir in the lemon juice and Kirsch. Pass the sauce in a sauceboat or bowl. Keep the sauce covered and refrigerated before and after use. The ingredients of Cooked Raspberry Sauce are 12 ounces individually quick-frozen raspberries, thawed, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon strained lemon juice, 1 teaspoon Kirsch or Framboise (raspberry eau-de-vie).Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag. Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.
