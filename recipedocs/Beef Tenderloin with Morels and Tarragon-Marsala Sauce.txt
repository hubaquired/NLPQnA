Add enough hot water to reach 1 1/2-cup mark; let soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup soaking liquid. Cut morels in half if large. Meanwhile, sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to skillet; add morels and green onions and sauté until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cream, 1 tablespoon tarragon, Marsala, and reserved 1/2 cup morel soaking liquid or beef broth; simmer until thickened to light sauce consistency, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
