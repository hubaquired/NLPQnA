Aunt Enza's Overstewed Green Beans recipe.  Put the onion and the garlic in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart pot, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and stir to coat the vegetables. Place the pot over low heat and cook the onion and garlic for 10 minutes or until tender. Add the tomato, green beans, and pepper or hot pepper) and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cooking time will depend on the quality and freshness of the beans, which should be tender and soft. Check after 10 minutes to make sure that cooking liquid is sufficient. Add 1/4 cup boiling water if necessary. If beans expel too much water, uncover and cook over high heat to thicken sauce. Add the basil, cook for 2-3 minutes, remove from heat, and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. The ingredients of Aunt Enza's Overstewed Green Beans are 1 small onion, chopped, 1 garlic clove, chopped, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 1/2 cups tomato pulp, 1 pound green beans, stem end snapped off, Freshly ground black pepper, fresh red hot pepper, or dried chili pepper flakes, Coarse sea salt, 1/4 cup boiling water, 2 tablespoons chopped basil.I, who struggled for years to achieve perfectly cooked, lively green beans love Aunt Enza's overstewed green beans, soft, almost creamy, tasting of bean, cooked far beyond crunch. Although Aunt Enza cooks the green beans in an onion and garlic-flavored tomato sauce she pointed out that leftover green beans can be subjected to the same treatment. Aunt Enza has a heavy Tuscan hand with extra virgin. I've cut down on the oil but my husband Massimo always adds a little extra at the table.
