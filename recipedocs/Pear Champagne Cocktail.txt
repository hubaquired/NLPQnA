Pear Champagne Cocktail recipe. Pour eau-de-vie into a Champagne flute and swirl around to coat inside of glass. Top off with Champagne. The ingredients of Pear Champagne Cocktail are 1 teaspoon Poire William or other pear eau-de-vie, 6 oz demi-sec Champagne or sparkling wine, chilled, Garnish: thin slices of pear.We chose to garnish our cocktail with Seckel or Forelle pear slices because of their small size â€” they fit perfectly in the Champagne flutes. Be sure to lower the slices slowly into the flute or the Champagne will bubble over.
