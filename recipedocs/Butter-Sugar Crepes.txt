Butter-Sugar Crepes recipe. Reserve 1 tablespoon melted butter for brushing skillet. Blend milk, flour, eggs, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth, then chill, covered, 30 minutes. Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with some of reserved butter and heat over medium heat until hot.
