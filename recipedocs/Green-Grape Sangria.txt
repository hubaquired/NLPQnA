Green-Grape Sangria recipe. Pureé grapes, apples, mint, sugar, vitamin C, and 2 cups wine in 2 batches in a blender until smooth, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids. Transfer pureé to a pitcher and stir in remaining wine. Chill, covered, at least 2 hours. Serve over ice. The ingredients of Green-Grape Sangria are 1 pound green grapes, 2 small Granny Smith apples, coarsely chopped, 1/4 cup packed mint leaves, 3/4 to 1 cup sugar (to taste), 1 (500-mg) vitamin C tablet, crushed to a powder with back of, a spoon (see cooks' note, below), 2 bottles dry white wine (preferably Albariño or Pinot Grigio).Surely you've had one too many supersweet sangrias whose fruit chunks overpower the (usually mediocre) wine. This version couldn't be more of a contrast, with a refreshing mintiness and subtly aromatic fruit that still allow the crispness of the white wine to come through.
