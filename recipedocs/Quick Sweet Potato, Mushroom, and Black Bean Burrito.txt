Quick Sweet Potato, Mushroom, and Black Bean Burrito recipe. Cook rice according to package directions. Fluff with a fork and stir in 1/3 cup salsa and 2 Tbsp. cilantro. Meanwhile, heat 1 Tbsp. oil over medium-high in a large nonstick skillet. Add sweet potato and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cumin, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne, then transfer to a large bowl. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in another large skillet, add mushrooms, and cook, stirring, until mushrooms begin to brown and release moisture, about 3 minutes. Add onion and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cumin, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne; cook, stirring, until mushrooms and onions are tender and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans and spinach; cook until warm, about 1 minute more. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with sweet potatoes, squeeze half of the lime over, and stir to combine. Place tortillas on a plate and cover with a damp towel. Microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Mix sour cream and remaining 1/3 cup salsa verde and 2 Tbsp. cilantro in a small bowl. Place warm tortillas on a work surface. Place 3 tbsp. cheese in the center of each tortilla, then top with 1 cup potato mixture and 1/4 cup rice. Divide avocado among tortillas and top each with 2 tbsp. sour cream sauce. Fold 2 sides of tortilla over filling, then roll up tortilla to enclose filling. Place burrito seam side down onto a plate and cut in half, if desired. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Cut remaining lime half into wedges and serve alongside.
