Millet-Scallion Pancakes recipe.  Cook millet in a large saucepan of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until tender, 15–20 minutes; drain, shaking off as much water as possible. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Meanwhile, whisk soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame seeds, Sriracha, and 1/4 of scallions in a small bowl; set sauce aside. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, cornstarch, sesame oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Fold in millet and 3/4 of scallions. Working in 3 batches, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add heaping spoonfuls of millet batter to skillet, press to 1/4" thickness, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a paper towel–lined plate. Sprinkle pancakes with more scallions and serve with reserved sauce. DO AHEAD: Millet can be cooked 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Millet batter can be made 6 hours ahead; cover and chill.
