Olive-Oil Pepper Biscuits recipe.  Whisk together flour, semolina, sugar, pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, then stir in wine and oil. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead with lightly floured hands until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Put dough in a lightly oiled large bowl and cover bowl with oiled plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Bring 4 cups water to a boil with remaining teaspoon sea salt in a medium pot. Meanwhile, halve dough, then cut each half into 10 pieces. Keeping remaining dough covered, roll 1 piece of dough into a 20-inch-long rope on an unfloured surface. Cut rope into 5 pieces, then roll each piece into a 4-inch-long rope, connecting ends of each to form a ring. Transfer to a lightly floured kitchen towel not terry cloth). Repeat with remaining dough. Preheat oven to 350Â°F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Oil 2 large baking sheets. Boil rings in 4 batches just until they float, about 2 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to oiled baking sheets, arranging rings 1/2 inch apart. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer to racks to cool completely. Olive-Oil Pepper Biscuits has 15.0 calories. Olive-Oil Pepper Biscuits has 1.0 grams of fat. Olive-Oil Pepper Biscuits has 59.0 grams of sodium.
