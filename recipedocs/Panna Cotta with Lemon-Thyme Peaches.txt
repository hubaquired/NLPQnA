Pour mixture into 4 small bowls and chill, covered, until set, at least 8 hours. Mince lemon thyme with sugar, then toss with peaches. Let macerate, stirring occasionally, at room temperature 20 minutes. While peaches macerate, let panna cotta stand at room temperature. Top bowls of panna cotta with peaches and their juice.

The ingredients of Panna Cotta with Lemon-Thyme Peaches are 1 1/4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-ounce envelope), 2 tablespoon water, 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, 1 cup plain low-fat yogurt, 1/4 cup mild honey, 1/8 teaspoon pure almond extract, 1 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon-thyme leaves, 1 tablespoon sugar, 3 peaches, peeled if desired, pitted, and thinly sliced.Though we can appreciate the beauty of a panna cotta that's been turned out of its mold, the light-as-air texture of these, just set enough to melt in the mouth, will have you happy to eat them right from the cup. Yogurt gives the almond-infused cream a little tang, and peaches that have been macerated with lemon thyme just long enough to meld and soften seem to exist expressly for this dessert.
