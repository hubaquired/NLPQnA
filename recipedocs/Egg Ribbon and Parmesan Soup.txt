You could say the restaurant business just runs in the family. My grandfather had his own restaurant, my husband is a chef, and I'm co-owner of the Mainly Café and Bakery, where I also happen to be the pastry chef. After I've spent all day baking — and tasting — sweets, it's good to go home and make "real food" to eat. Because I'm busy, I like dinnertime to be organized. My secret is keeping the pantry well stocked with basics like olive oil, kosher salt, and a variety of pastas and beans.".  Soup Stew Egg Pasta Parmesan Winter Bon Appétit.
