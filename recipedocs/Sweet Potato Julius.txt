Sweet Potato Julius recipe. In a high-speed blender, combine the almond milk, sweet potato, orange, date, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon and blend until smooth. Adjust the sweetness to your desired taste by adding honey or more Medjool dates. Blend in about 1/2 cup ice to chill before serving. The ingredients of Sweet Potato Julius are 1 cup almond milk, 1 medium sweet potato, baked whole, 1 medium orange, peeled, 1 Medjool date, or more to taste, pitted, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, Dash of sea salt, Dash of ground cinnamon, Honey (optional).The first “real” recipe I ever tried was for the famous orange Julius. It was back in home-ec class and the no-fail recipe instantly became my favorite. Now I’m giving traditional orange Julius an upgrade by combining the vitamins C and A, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids found in sweet potatoes with tangy orange. This is a winning combination, light and refreshing with pops of citrus, yet dense and filling because of the sweet potato. Enjoy this as a meal or post-workout drink, or split it with a loved one for a snack! It’s ridiculously good.  HarperCollins Drink Vegan Vegetarian Sweet Potato Yam Almond Orange Smoothie.
