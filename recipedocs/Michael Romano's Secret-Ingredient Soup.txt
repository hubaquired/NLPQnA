Michael Romano's Secret-Ingredient Soup recipe. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain off the excess fat, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pan. Stir in the cornmeal. Add the stock, stirring, and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the greens and cook for 15 minutes more, or until tender. Ladle into bowls and garnish with grated Parmigiano. Michael Romano's Secret-Ingredient Soup has 318.0 calories.
