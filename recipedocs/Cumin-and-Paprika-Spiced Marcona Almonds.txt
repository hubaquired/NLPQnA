Cumin-and-Paprika-Spiced Marcona Almonds recipe. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, whisk together the egg white, salt, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and the cayenne. Add the almonds and toss to coat. Spread the almonds out evenly on the prepared baking sheet and roast until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through. Transfer to a plate to cool for about 30 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of cumin and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of paprika. Sprinkle this mixture over the cooled nuts. Store in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.

The ingredients of Cumin-and-Paprika-Spiced Marcona Almonds are 1 egg white, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon cumin, for dusting, 1 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon sweet or smoked Spanish paprika, for dusting, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, 3 cups blanched Marcona almonds.Almonds were brought to Spain by the Moors, and they've featured in Andalusian cuisine ever since. Typically they are used as a thickener for sauces and, most famously, as the base of ajo blanco. Whole Marcona almonds are roasted with sweet or hot smoked paprika–I prefer to use sweet paprika, introduce a little heat via cayenne, and round it out with cumin and salt. In the event of a crippling Marcona almond shortage, regular blanched almonds will do the trick. .
