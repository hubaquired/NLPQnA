Italian Strawberry Tart recipe.  Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a spring-form pan. Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the butter and the sugar. Add the eggs and milk. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and stir by hand until just moistened. Do not overmix. Spread the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Press strawberry halves deeply into the dough in a circular pattern of 2 or 3 rings. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm with whipped cream and strawberries, if desired. Italian Strawberry Tart has 338.0 calories.
