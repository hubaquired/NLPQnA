Sticky Rice Stuffing with Chinese Sausage and Shiitakes recipe.  Rinse the rice in a colander, and then transfer to a medium bowl. Cover with 1 inch of water and let soak at room temperature overnight. Drain thoroughly. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and toast, stirring, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving skillet. Return skillet to medium heat and add oil. When oil is hot, add the shallots and mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the shallots are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sausage and cook until the sausages curl slightly, 1 minute more. Add the sherry, bring to a boil, and cook until syrupy, about 1 minute. Add the soy sauce, chestnuts, rice, and toasted pine nuts and toss until the rice kernels are evenly coated. Stir in the broth or water and season with salt. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the rice is cooked, 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish rice "stuffing" with sliced scallions before serving.
