The ingredients of Smoked Salmon Toasts with Malt Vinegar Syrup are 1/2 cup apple cider, 1/4 cup malt vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons mild honey, 1 (4-inch long) sprig fresh thyme, 16 (1/2-inch thick) diagonal slices from a baguette, 1/2 cup créme fraîche, 1/4 pound thinly sliced smoked salmon.The Irish are famous for their smoked salmon, so it's a natural for a St. Patrick's Day party. Of course, you don't have to use Irish smoked salmon for these toasts; any coldsmoked salmon will work well, but if you're feeling flush, you will be treating yourself to salmon that is supersilky in texture with a distinct smokiness that comes from spending time near smoldering hardwoods such as oak and beechwood. If topping your salmon with anything other than a gentle squeeze of lemon seems like heresy, don't knock our tangysweet malt vinegar syrup until you've tried it. You just might get hooked.
