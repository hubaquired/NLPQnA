Franks and Beans recipe. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5-8 minutes. Remove and discard casings from 2 sausages; add sausages to pot. Cook, breaking up with a spoon, until sausages and onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add beans and wine to pot and cook until wine is reduced by half, 8-10 minutes. Using kitchen twine, tie parsley and thyme into a bundle; add to pot along with bay leaves and broth. Cook on medium-low heat, partially covered and stirring often, until liquid thickens, 40-50 minutes. Discard bundle and bay leaves. Mix in butter and 2 tablespoons chopped herbs.
