Two-Grain Pancakes recipe.  In a bowl whisk together the cornmeal, the flours, the baking powder, the sugar, and the salt, add the egg, the milk, and the butter, and whisk the batter until it is blended well. Heat a griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with oil. Working in batches, drop the batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, cook the pancakes for 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer them as they are cooked to a platter. Serve the pancakes with the syrup. The ingredients of Two-Grain Pancakes are 1/3 cup cornmeal (preferably stone-ground), 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 large egg, beaten lightly, 3/4 cup milk, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, vegetable oil for brushing the griddle, pure maple syrup, heated, as an accompaniment.The Indian staple cornmeal became a mainstay of Colonial cooking; European arrivals used it to stretch their scarce wheat flour. We have adopted the same tactic with our modern edition of the venerable breakfast dish, pancakes. They are, of course, also a good excuse to bring out the maple syrup, another gift from the Indians.
