Lentil and Red Pepper Frittata recipe.  Add lentils to a large saucepan of salted water and bring water to a boil. Cook lentils at a bare simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove skillet from heat and stir in lentils, drained well, and salt and pepper to taste. Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large bowl whisk together eggs and parsley. Spread lentil mixture in a buttered 6- by 8-cup gratin dish and pour egg mixture over it. Shake dish gently to distribute eggs evenly and top with Gruyère.
