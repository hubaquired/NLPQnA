Crab Meat Stuffed Artichoke Salad recipe.  There's an art to preparing artichokes for the table. The stem should be cut flush with the base and the tight top leaves of the artichoke sliced off to remove the prickly leaf tips. Each side leaf should have its prickle snipped off with scissors. Then boil for 25 to 40 minutes in salted water. The artichoke is done when an outer leaf pulls out easily. Drain well upside down, and while still warm from the cooking, prepare for salad. Press the leaves gently back so that the artichoke lies open like a flower. Pull out the cone of undeveloped white leaves. Scrape out choke with a spoon. Chill. Mix the crab meat, celery, green pepper, onion juice and mayonnaise together; add nutmeg, salt and paprika. Heap this on the artichoke heart and decorate with the capers. Pass a bowl of mayonnaise at the table. Crab Meat Stuffed Artichoke Salad has 149.0 calories. Crab Meat Stuffed Artichoke Salad has 5.0 grams of protein.
