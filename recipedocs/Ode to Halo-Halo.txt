Ode to Halo-Halo recipe.  Combine bananas, brown sugar, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until bananas are jammy and liquid is slightly thickened, 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine berries, lime juice, granulated sugar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Mash berries lightly to release juices. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until juices are slightly thickened, 15–20 minutes. Stir coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk in a small bowl to combine. Assemble halo-halo in 2 small bowls or pint glasses, alternating layers of bananas, berries, shaved ice, ice cream, and coconut milk mixture. Top as desired. The ingredients of Ode to Halo-Halo are 2 very ripe bananas, sliced 1/4-inch thick, 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, Kosher salt, 6 ounces fresh blueberries (about 1 cup), 6 ounces fresh blackberries (about 1 1/2 cups), cut in half if large, 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk, 2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk, 4 cups shaved ice, 1/2 pint vanilla or coconut ice cream, Toasted unsweetened coconut flakes, gummi bears, and/or popcorn (for serving).It doesn't get any cooler than halo-halo, the Filipino treat with a base of fluffy shaved ice. Macerating the fruit makes it extra juicy and saucy, but you could just throw in any unadulterated berry. The key to this dessert (as with any sundae) is a mix of textures: icy, creamy, chewy, crunchy.  Bon Appétit Frozen Dessert Dessert Philippines Berry Banana Coconut Kid-Friendly Back to School.
