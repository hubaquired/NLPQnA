Cheddar, Onion, and Red Bell Pepper Souffléd Omelet recipe.  Preheat oven to 375°F. Cook onion and bell pepper in butter in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened. Add milk and bring to a boil. Add cornmeal in a slow stream, whisking, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool 5 minutes. Whisk in cheese, parsley, yolks, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Beat whites with cream of tartar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold one fourth of whites into cornmeal mixture to lighten, then fold cornmeal mixture gently but thoroughly into remaining whites. Spoon mixture into a greased 3-quart casserole and smooth top. Bake in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve immediately.

Do not substitute polenta, however; it made the soufflé much too heavy.  Cheese Egg Onion Pepper Low Fat Cheddar Bell Pepper Gourmet.
