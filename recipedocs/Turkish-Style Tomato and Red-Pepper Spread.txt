This recipe is the delicious solution. Leftover tomato paste (from our Sausage–Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad) gets puréed with roasted red peppers, walnuts, and garlic to become a luscious, deeply flavored spread. This easy recipe makes a lot, so it's perfect for a party. And it's so good that it's even worth cracking open a fresh can (it will taste just fine if you use the whole thing).
