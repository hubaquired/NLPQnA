The ingredients of Homemade Ginger Beer are About 1/4 pound ginger, peeled, 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast, About 2 quarts water, a Microplane grater; a funnel; a clean 2-liter plastic bottle with cap.Unlike supermarket ginger ales, which are made with carbonated water, corn syrup, and ginger flavoring, this spicy ginger beer is made the old-fashioned way, with lots of fresh grated ginger, sugar, yeast, and water. As the yeast ferments over a day or so, it creates a natural carbonation. Though many recipes leave the ginger sediment as is, we think straining it out produces a more refined quaff.
