The ingredients of Toasted Sweet Corn Pudding are 1 (7 1/2-ounces) package Cope's corn (toasted dried sweet corn), 4 cups whole milk, 1 cup well-shaken buttermilk (not powdered), 4 large eggs, lightly beaten, 1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.In this golden casserole (which you'll find on many Pennsylvania Dutch tables), a buttermilk custard rises to the top while the chewy, toasty corn sinks to the bottom, resulting in a two-layered pudding. The packaged sweet corn—frequently called by its most common brand name, Cope's corn—is slowly dried so that its natural sugars caramelize, a centuries-old Native American preservation method. Recipes usually call for grinding the corn, but the whole kernels impart a coarser texture that we love.
