Lemon and Fresh Herb Tabbouleh recipe. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Stir together the bulgur and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a heatproof bowl. Add boiling water to cover. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand for 15 minutes. Drain in a sieve, pressing on the bulgur to remove any excess liquid. Transfer the bulgur to a large bowl and toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the rest of the ingredients until everything is well mixed. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Serve cold. The ingredients of Lemon and Fresh Herb Tabbouleh are 1/2 cup medium- or fine-grain bulgur, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 2 cups finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (about 3 bunches), 3/4 cup diced red onion, 2 medium tomatoes, seeded and diced, 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh mint, 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil, 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice.We've been making tabbouleh for years, but when Fran's Iranian friend Parvine Latimore made it for a special party, we both changed our recipes. Parvine used extra lemon juice and more fresh herbs than we were used to. The result was incredibleâ€”a delicious taste of lemon with every bite of grain and a burst of freshness from the blend of fresh herbs with every mouthful.
