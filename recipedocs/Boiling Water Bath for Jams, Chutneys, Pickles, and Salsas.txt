Wipe the top and inside rim of the jar with a clean, damp paper towel before covering the top with the lid. Screw on the bands. With a sturdy pair of tongs, place the jars on a rack or a thick folded dish towel in the pot of boiling water. Process the jars with the water at a gentle boil for the time required in the recipe. If necessary, during processing, add more boiling water to cover the jars by 1 to 2 inches. Remove the jars from the water bath and allow to cool. After 12 hours, check to see that the jars are sealed by pressing on the center of the lid. It should remain concave. Label and date the jars by writing on the lids with a permanent marker. Remove the screw bands to prevent them from rusting on and store the jars for up to 1 year in a cool, dark place. The ideal temperature for storage is 50° to 70°.
