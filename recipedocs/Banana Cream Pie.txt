My order? A slice of banana cream pie: the topping whipped high, the creamy filling offering comfort far from home. To elevate this classic in my own kitchen, I add sliced bananas to the hot (and simple) custard to infuse it with flavor. And did I mention chocolate's involved? It's my take on diner deluxe. —Janet Taylor McCracken.  Milk Cream Dessert Banana Summer Bon Appétit Vegetarian Pescatarian Peanut Free Tree Nut Free Soy Free Kosher.
