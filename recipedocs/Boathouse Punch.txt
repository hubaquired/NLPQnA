The ingredients of Boathouse Punch are Peels of 4 lemons, 1/2 cup superfine sugar, 1 (1-liter) bottle gin (I recommend Bombay Dry or Bombay Sapphire), 1 (750-ml) bottle Aperol, 12 ounces St. Germain elderflower liqueur, 12 ounces lemon juice, 12 ounces orange juice, 12 ounces grapefruit juice, Large ice block, 1 (750-ml) bottle sparkling rosé wine, Garnish with lemon wheels (from 2 lemons).At the bar, we have giant ice molds to make the ice cubes that keep this punch cold, but when I do it at home, a Tupperware container works just as well. Fill a 1-quart to 2-quart container with hot water (which freezes into clearer ice) and stick it in the freezer twenty-four hours before the party. Then add the giant cube to your punch bowl right before the guests arrive; it keeps everything cold and looks beautiful.  Gin Punch Alcoholic Grapefruit Sparkling Wine Lemon Juice Orange Juice Drink.
