I try to eat as healthfully as I can during the workweek, and I stay away from processed foods — I'd rather have something simple and fresh anyway. But on the weekends, when my husband and I entertain, I love to splurge and make desserts. Since they are the first thing people remember about a great dinner, they are definitely worth the effort. The dried-fruit strudel here is a family recipe I learned from my grandfather, but I've simplified it so it can be made quickly with purchased pie crust.".
