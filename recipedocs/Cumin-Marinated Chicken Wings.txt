Cumin-Marinated Chicken Wings recipe.  Cut off the wing tips, reserving them for another use such as stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joint. In a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag mix together the buttermilk, the garlic, 3 tablespoons of the cumin, and the salt. Add the wings, tossing them to coat them well, and let them marinate, chilled, for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain the wings and bake them, skin side up, on the oiled rack of a broiler pan in a preheated 475Â°F. oven for 15 minutes. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon cumin, the lemon juice, and salt to taste and brush the wings with the mixture. Bake the wings for 10 minutes more, or until they are golden.
