Sammy's Asada recipe. Put the pepper, garlic, oregano, lime and orange juices, and olive oil in a large nonreactive mixing bowl and whisk until the marinade emulsifies. Pour the marinade into a large zip-lock bag and add the steak, shaking until the meat gets well coated. You can also put the steak directly in the mixing bowl, but you'll want to turn it at least once while the meat is marinating.) Refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no longer than overnight. When you're ready to start cooking, remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry, and let the meat come to room temperature. Preheat an outdoor grill over a medium-high flame and brush the grates of the grill with oil so the meat doesn't stick. You can also broil the meat in the oven.) Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and grill or broil) for about 7 minutes per side. I like mine medium-rare. If you don't, grill or broil) about 2 minutes more. Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes, then slice it diagonally against the grain. Warm up your tortillas. Get your rice, beans, and guacamole ready, and you're good to go. Sammy's Asada has 718.0 calories. Sammy's Asada has 46.0 grams of protein. Sammy's Asada has 56.0 grams of fat.
