Rose Beef Bites with Horseradish Cream recipe.  Preheat the oven to 350°F. Slice the baguette into 18 thin circles. Brush both sides of each slice with melted butter. Place the baguette circles on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for about 7-10 minutes, turning halfway through, until brown, then let cool. To make the horseradish cream, combine the crème fraîche or sour cream with the horseradish and season to taste. When the baguette circles have cooled, place a spoonful of horseradish cream on top of each one. Cut each slice of beef in half lengthwise, then roll it up to form a pretty rose spiral. Place a roll of beef on top of each baguette circle, then garnish with watercress leaves. The ingredients of Rose Beef Bites with Horseradish Cream are 1 small baguette, 2 tablespoons butter, melted, 9 thin slices of rare roast beef, 18 watercress leaves, 1/2 cup crème fraîhe or sour cream, 1 tablespoon grated horseradish, salt and black pepper.I insisted that the theme of my coming-of-age party be mocktails and canapes because I wanted to be grown up, and had often seen my mum eat canapes at parties. My Rose Beef Bites are delicate and also delicious, with beef and horseradish being lifelong friends. Spending a tiny amount of time to be sure the beef looks pretty makes these canapés stunning to behold. Assemble the beef before the party, so then it's only a matter of spread, drop, serve, and smile!.  Beef Cocktail Party Wedding Horseradish Party.
