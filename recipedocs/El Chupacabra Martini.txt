El Chupacabra Martini recipe. In a cocktail shaker combine all ingredients with ice. Shake until blended and then strain into 2 martini glasses. Garnish each glass with a blood orange slice or a star fruit slice. Serve. The ingredients of El Chupacabra Martini are Freshly squeezed juice of 4 blood oranges or 1 cup orange juice, 4 ounces coconut rum, 2 ounces açaí juice, 1 ounce guava nectar, 1 ounce pineapple nectar, 1 cup crushed ice, 1 blood orange, sliced, for garnish, 1 star fruit, sliced (optional), for garnish.Translated into English as "the Goat Sucker," El Chupacabra is a mythical creature known for its nocturnal prowling and as the culprit in weird livestock deaths. There are various descriptions of the creature, which is believed to be heavy, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines stretching from head to tail. Maybe you've heard the silly stories. My fascination with this mythical creature inspired me to invent a drink as its namesake. This martini is infused with fiery red blood orange juice and the explosive Brazilian aphrodisiac açaí, making this an exotic bright red cocktail full of drama and flavor. Açaí juice is actually very healthy and has 33 times the antioxidant content of red wine grapes. Hints of guava and pineapple nectar in this drink are fruits from Puerto Rico (where Chupacabra sightings were first reported). The understated tones of coconut rum make this drink equally dangerous, so sip with caution.  Rum Alcoholic Cocktail Party Halloween Cinco de Mayo Cocktail Martini Orange Orange Juice Drink.
