Avgolemono recipe.  In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Stir in the rice and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and lemon juice together in a large bowl. When the rice is tender, slowly ladle half of the hot broth into the yolks to temper them, whisking constantly. Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the broth and place over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, just long enough to thicken the soup. Do not boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
