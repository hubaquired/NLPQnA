Potato Pancakes recipe. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Peel potatoes and place in cold water. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and pepper to taste. Set aside. Pat potatoes dry and grate on the large holes of a grater. Long grated shreds are best.) Place grated potatoes in a large bowl, add onion, and toss. Add flour mixture and toss, breaking up clumps. This may take a bit of time, as the dry ingredients must be well distributed.) Add eggs and combine well. In a large nonstick skillet, heat about 1" oil over high heat. Test heat by carefully dropping a little piece of potato in the oil. If it bubbles violently, the oil is ready. Using a slotted spoon, place spoonfuls of potato mixture drained of excess liquid) into oil. Fry until just golden, about 2 minutes on each side. They will not be cooked through.) Drain on paper towels. Continue until all potato mixture is used. Note: As you get toward the bottom of the bowl, the potatoes will be wetter. They will need to be pressed and will take a bit longer to cook. Arrange latkes on a baking sheet; transfer to oven and bake for about 10 minutes on each side. They will turn a rich golden brown. Season with salt to taste. Serve with applesauce and sour cream, if desired. Potato Pancakes has 314.0 calories. Potato Pancakes has 3.0 grams of protein. Potato Pancakes has 24.0 grams of fat.
