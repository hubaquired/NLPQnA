Chocolate Chip Cookie and Mint Ice Cream Sandwiches recipe. Preheat oven to 350°F. Shape dough pieces into balls. Arrange on baking sheet and flatten to 1/2-inch thickness; press nuts onto each. Bake until golden, 12 to 18 minutes, depending on brand of cookie. Cool completely on sheet. Meanwhile, mix ice cream, fresh mint, and extract in small bowl; place in freezer until ready to use. Line baking sheet with foil. Place 1/4 cup ice cream on flat side of 1 cookie. Top with flat side of second cookie. Place on prepared sheet and freeze. Repeat to form 7 more sandwiches.
