The ingredients of Sour Orange, Red Onion, and Parsley Mojo are Juice of 5 Seville (sour) oranges (about 1 cup), 1 red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice, 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt.This recipe differs slightly from classic mojo in that it uses red onion instead of garlic. It's best to make this mojo a bit ahead of time so that the color of the red onion "bleeds" into the sour orange. The traditional accompaniment is grilled pork, but it's also wonderful with well-roasted chicken â€” charring its skin brings out the full flavors of the mojo.
