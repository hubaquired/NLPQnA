Passover Chremslach recipe. Mix together the matzahs, currants, almonds, apricots, egg yolks, matzah meal, sugar, lemon rind, and lemon juice. Beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold into the matzah mixture, adding matzah meal to make the mixture hold together. Using an electric skillet or deep fryer, heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees. Drop the mixture by tablespoons and brown a few minutes on each side until they are crisp. Cook only about three at a time. Drain well on paper. Serve at room temperature or crisped up in the oven. The fritters are especially delicious with stewed prunes with orange juice as an accompaniment, if desired. Note: You can make these in the morning, drain on paper, leave out all day, and crisp in the oven just before serving. Passover Chremslach has 183.0 calories.
