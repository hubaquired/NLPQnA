Shake the pan to distribute the sugar and water and caramelize over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally. The sugar will gradually liquefy and darken; when it becomes golden brown, remove from the heat. Carefully add the nam pla it may spatter; hold the pan at arm's length), then return to the heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook, stirring, until softened. Add the chicken wings and coat with the sauce. Gently stir in the ginger and pepper and continue stirring until the chicken browns slightly, about 4 minutes. Cover and cook for 7 minutes, then transfer to the oven and cook for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken wings, which should now be a rich caramel color, garnish with cilantro and cracked black pepper, and serve.
