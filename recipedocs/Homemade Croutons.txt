Homemade Croutons recipe.  Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Trim crusts from bread and discard. Lightly butter both sides of each slice or, if you prefer, first blend butter with crushed garlic). I often substitute fruity extra-virgin olive oil for butter, sometimes plain, sometimes mixed with 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic. Because bread absorbs more oil than softened butter, 1 1/2 tablespoons oil is about right. Cut each buttered slice into 1/3-inch cubes and spread in a single layer, not touching, on an ungreased large baking sheet. Slide onto the middle oven shelf and toast about 15 minutes until pale tan.

The ingredients of Homemade Croutons are 3 slices stale firm-textured white bread, 1 tablespoon or more softened unsalted butter, or 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic (optional).Croutons can be tricky. The store-bought versions are often too large, too salty, and too garlicky. So I prefer to make my own. I usually make several batches of croutons and store them in a resealable plastic bag in the freezer so I'll have them on hand. They taste "just-made" for weeks.  Bake Gourmet.
