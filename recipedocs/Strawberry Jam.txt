Strawberry Jam recipe. Chill two small plates for testing jam. In heavy 5-quart pot, combine 6 cups strawberries and sugar. Using potato masher, crush and mix fruit. Set mixture over moderate heat, bring to boil, and cook, skimming and stirring frequently, 10 minutes. Add lemon juice and 2 to 3 tablespoons water. Lower heat to moderate, maintain gentle boil, and cook, uncovered, skimming and stirring frequently, another 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and test jam for doneness: drop spoonful onto chilled plate and refrigerate 1 minute, then tilt plate; jam should remain in soft mound and run slightly. If jam is very runny, return pot to heat and continue boiling 10 minutes, then re-test. When jam reaches proper consistency, stir in remaining strawberries, Campari, and orange zest.
