Pizza 6: Pan-fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe.  Preheat the broiler. Add a little oil to a medium cast-iron pan and fry the ham over medium-low heat until it's a little brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Roll each pizza dough half into circles the size of your cast-iron pan. The dough will probably be slightly thicker than what you're used to. Heat the pan to medium and add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add 1 piece of the rolled-out dough. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is bubbly on top and browned underneath. Flip, add half of the sauce, half of the mozzarella, half of the ham, and half of the pineapple. Cook another 2 minutes, until the bottom is cooked, then slip under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cheese looks bubbly and the pineapple is slightly caramelized. Top with basil. Remove the pizza from the pan, and repeat with the other piece of dough. Pizza 6: Pan-fried Hawaiian Pizza has 2036.0 calories. Pizza 6: Pan-fried Hawaiian Pizza has 58.0 grams of protein.
