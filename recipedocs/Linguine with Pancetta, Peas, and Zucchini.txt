Linguine with Pancetta, Peas, and Zucchini recipe. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic and cook until the scallions are wilted, about 3 minutes. Add the linguine to the boiling water. Once the pasta is cooking, add the peas and zucchini to the skillet and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Toss until the zucchini begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Ladle in 1 cup pasta water and simmer and reduce by half while the pasta cooks. When the pasta is al dente, remove it with a spider or small strainer and add directly to the sauce, along with the basil and parsley, reserving the pasta water. Toss to coat the pasta with the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if the pasta seems dry. Remove the skillet from the heat, sprinkle with the grated Grana Padano, toss, and serve. The ingredients of Linguine with Pancetta, Peas, and Zucchini are 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 ounces pancetta, diced, 1 cup chopped scallions, 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, 1 pound linguine, 1 cup frozen peas, 2 medium zucchini, peeled into ribbons (see headnote), Kosher salt, Crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped, 1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, chopped, 1/2 cup freshly grated Grana Padano.Use a vegetable peeler to peel the zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons, stopping when you get to the very center where it is all seeds. You can use this same technique with carrots and peel long carrot ribbons, or also choose to use half carrots and half zucchini. The zucchini (or carrots or both) sliced this way also make a light, fresh summer salad when tossed raw with lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh herbs.
