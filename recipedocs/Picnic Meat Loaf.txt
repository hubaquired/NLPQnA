Picnic Meat Loaf recipe. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients but the hard-boiled eggs. Press half the mixture into the pan, then gently press in the hard-boiled eggs, end to end. Mold the remaining mixture on top. Cover with foil and bake until the juices run clear when you poke the loaf with a sharp knife, 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes. Take the loaf from the pan, let it cool completely, then wrap it well and chill overnight. Picnic Meat Loaf has 393.0 calories. Picnic Meat Loaf has 25.0 grams of protein.
