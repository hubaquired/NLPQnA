Grilled Grapefruit with Pomegranate Molasses Glaze recipe.  Light a grill for direct medium-high heat, about 425Â°F . Mix the pomegranate molasses, brown sugar, butter, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a small bowl with a whisk until smooth. Using a sharp paring knife, remove the peel and bitter white pith from the grapefruits. Cut the fruit crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices, and then brush all over with the pomegranate molasses glaze. Brush the grill grate and coat with oil. Grill the grapefruit directly over the heat until nicely grill-marked, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and brush with any remaining glaze.

But they're even better sliced to expose more of the fruit to the caramelizing fire. Pomegranate molasses, with its sweet-tart flavor and syrupy texture, makes a tasty, ruby-hued glaze.
