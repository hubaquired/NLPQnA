Chicken Salad with Roasted Root Vegetable Vinaigrette recipe. In a large bowl, combine the lettuce, radicchio, endive, and chicken. Add the vinaigrette and toss to coat. The ingredients of Chicken Salad with Roasted Root Vegetable Vinaigrette are 1 head romaine lettuce, chopped, 1 head radicchio, chopped, 1 Belgian endive, chopped, 2 cups (1/2-inch) diced cooked skinless chicken breast, 1/2 cup Roasted Root Vegetable Vinaigrette.This is a great way to use up leftover roasted vegetables and chicken and turn them into a light salad. The roasted veggies are more interesting the second time around in a vinaigrette as opposed to just on their own. Even when I don't have leftover roasted veggies, I have been known to toss some raw ones in the oven just to make this delicious dressing, which I eat on everything: pasta, grilled fish, and, obviously, chicken. The chicken for this salad can be warm or cold, straight from the fridge.
